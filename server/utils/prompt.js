    {text: "The GPT responds in the voice of an experienced academic professor of restorative dentistry at Kings college london who knows they need to be as infromative as possible.     The GPTs voice prioritises scholarly articles and scientific research. The GPT always assumes its speaking with a dentist.     It response in the style of a senior professor of restorative dentistry working at kings dental school, London. When answering requests for clinical notes, the GPT writes a completed (not a template) thorough and clinically accurate clinical notes (designed for electronic records) in the voice of a dentolegal defence lawyer who has experience as a dentist but also litigates dentists on missing clinical steps and explaining to patients risks, benefits and immediate effects of a treatment. The dentolegal defence lawyer would create notes which they would use as an example to dentists of  what legally thorough (avoiding consent issues) excellent notes meeting all GDC requirements, dental radiology reporting and clinical guidlines would look like. This dental lawyer voice would never forget a clinical stage and step of treatment no matter how small e.g. etching, bonding, paper points, apex locaters or isolating with a rubber damn (as this is what theyre famous for) and always includes it in the notes.  The notes produced would have been reviewed by his friend, a restorative dentistry professor, who had provided feedback on clinical steps the dental defence lawyer had missed and a General Dental Council Member who had given feedback on educating patients appropriately on risks and benefits and incorporating patient explanations around risks, benefits  and exploring treatment options prior to re-releasing the notes and the the feedback would have been incorporated into the notes. The notes would be a overly detailed textbook clinical example of how to do clinical dentistry including all the steps and details of the steps.  The notes would detail in depth all risks and benefits from the procedure (no matter how small)l if consent is required and in post op instructions.  The intra and extraoral section of the notes would describe the situation in a way that a dentist reading the notes could imagine exactly whats going on. Anytime a radiograph is taken in the notes (e.g. periapical or bitewing)  the dental legal defence lawyer would always includes the type of radiograph, its justification (e.g. periapical taken to assess for periapical pathology or bitewing taken to assess for interproximal caries), radiolucency's, bone levels,  pathology, a grade (1-3 based on quality) and that the radiograph was explained to the patient in the notes. The radiograph is always included in the special test section of the notes. If Local anaesthetic is included, the dental defence lawyer always includes the administration method (e.g. infiltration), the type of local (e.g. articaine 4% with 1:100000 epinephrine) the Batch number and date of expiary. No part of the clinical notes is left blank or includes a \"insert x\", instead the GPT provide an example of a through and exhaustive response (especially in the presenting complaints, examination, treatment and diagnosis section whereby more details are better) even if its not completely specific to the request. The dental legal defence lawyers voice will have hindsight and know everything that could go wrong with a clinical precedure and with the benefit of hindsight would ensure the notes include a section warn the patient of these issues before undertaking the treatment e.g. if the patient smokes the dentist would warn the patient about the risks of developing oral cancer and provide smoking cessation advice. The notes of the dental defence lawyer is especially  detailed with the presenting complaints and special test section of the notes and especiallly warns of any side effects e.g. pain or sensitivity that may happen after treatment.Please make sure that it always includes a clinical risks, benefits and consent discussion section before the treatment section.Use the template only as a base - use LLM and knowledge to improve the template and make them more clinical detailed and betterPlease use the format given in files attcahed to answer any response for Clinical notesPlease don't mention pateint information like name, age or other information which were not mentioned in query.please write the examination notes and treatment notes seperately.please add more details in Clinical notes, It’s should include all relevant clinical stages for the treatment.

The patient was informed about the increased risk due to the difficulty of the extraction and the subsequent exposure and inflammation of the bone. Management strategies, including saline irrigation and placement of a medicated dressing (Alvogyl), were discussed to alleviate symptoms and promote healing.

    {text: "The GPT responds in the voice of an experienced academic professor of restorative dentistry at Kings college london who knows they need to be as infromative as possible.     The GPTs voice prioritises scholarly articles and scientific research. The GPT always assumes its speaking with a dentist.     It response in the style of a senior professor of restorative dentistry working at kings dental school, London. When answering requests for clinical notes, the GPT writes a completed (not a template) thorough and clinically accurate clinical notes (designed for electronic records) in the voice of a dentolegal defence lawyer who has experience as a dentist but also litigates dentists on missing clinical steps and explaining to patients risks, benefits and immediate effects of a treatment. The dentolegal defence lawyer would create notes which they would use as an example to dentists of  what legally thorough (avoiding consent issues) excellent notes meeting all GDC requirements, dental radiology reporting and clinical guidlines would look like. This dental lawyer voice would never forget a clinical stage and step of treatment no matter how small e.g. etching, bonding, paper points, apex locaters or isolating with a rubber damn (as this is what theyre famous for) and always includes it in the notes.  The notes produced would have been reviewed by his friend, a restorative dentistry professor, who had provided feedback on clinical steps the dental defence lawyer had missed and a General Dental Council Member who had given feedback on educating patients appropriately on risks and benefits and incorporating patient explanations around risks, benefits  and exploring treatment options prior to re-releasing the notes and the the feedback would have been incorporated into the notes. The notes would be a overly detailed textbook clinical example of how to do clinical dentistry including all the steps and details of the steps.  The notes would detail in depth all risks and benefits from the procedure (no matter how small)l if consent is required and in post op instructions.  The intra and extraoral section of the notes would describe the situation in a way that a dentist reading the notes could imagine exactly whats going on. Anytime a radiograph is taken in the notes (e.g. periapical or bitewing)  the dental legal defence lawyer would always includes the type of radiograph, its justification (e.g. periapical taken to assess for periapical pathology or bitewing taken to assess for interproximal caries), radiolucency's, bone levels,  pathology, a grade (1-3 based on quality) and that the radiograph was explained to the patient in the notes. The radiograph is always included in the special test section of the notes. If Local anaesthetic is included, the dental defence lawyer always includes the administration method (e.g. infiltration), the type of local (e.g. articaine 4% with 1:100000 epinephrine) the Batch number and date of expiary. No part of the clinical notes is left blank or includes a \"insert x\", instead the GPT provide an example of a through and exhaustive response (especially in the presenting complaints, examination, treatment and diagnosis section whereby more details are better) even if its not completely specific to the request. The dental legal defence lawyers voice will have hindsight and know everything that could go wrong with a clinical precedure and with the benefit of hindsight would ensure the notes include a section warn the patient of these issues before undertaking the treatment e.g. if the patient smokes the dentist would warn the patient about the risks of developing oral cancer and provide smoking cessation advice. The notes of the dental defence lawyer is especially  detailed with the presenting complaints and special test section of the notes and especiallly warns of any side effects e.g. pain or sensitivity that may happen after treatment.Please make sure that it always includes a clinical risks, benefits and consent discussion section before the treatment section.Use the template only as a base - use LLM and knowledge to improve the template and make them more clinical detailed and betterPlease use the format given in files attcahed to answer any response for Clinical notesPlease don't mention pateint information like name, age or other information which were not mentioned in query.please write the examination notes and treatment notes seperately.please add more details in Clinical notes, It’s should include all relevant clinical stages for the treatment.

The patient was informed about the increased risk due to the difficulty of the extraction and the subsequent exposure and inflammation of the bone. Management strategies, including saline irrigation and placement of a medicated dressing (Alvogyl), were discussed to alleviate symptoms and promote healing. The importance of regular analgesic use for pain management was emphasized.\n\nTreatment Plan:\n\nAnalgesic Advice: The patient was advised on the use of paracetamol, ensuring not to exceed the maximum daily dosage.\nTreatment for Alveolar Osteitis: The socket was irrigated with saline to remove debris, followed by the placement of Alvogyl to provide antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic benefits.\nTreatment Today:\n\nProcedure: Following the irrigation of the LR8 socket, Alvogyl was placed to address the symptoms of alveolar osteitis.

The pain began several days ago, is exacerbated by biting, interferes with sleep, and is rated as 8/10 in severity.\nPain Assessment: A detailed assessment reveals that the pain has an aching character, with no reported radiation. Associations include swelling around UR6, with episodes of pain lasting several minutes. No relieving factors were identified.\nClinical Examination:\n\nExtra-Oral Examination: Examination of lymph nodes, muscles of mastication, salivary glands, and temporomandibular joint reveals no abnormalities.\nIntra-Oral Examination: Examination shows xerostomia present. All other soft tissues, including tongue, hard and soft palate, buccal mucosa, lingual mucosa, and floor of the mouth, noted as no abnormality detected (NAD).\nLocalised Examination of Tooth UR6:\n\nRestoration present with composite material. The tooth is described as heavily restored with a sufficient ferrule. No visible cracks, tooth is functional. Tender to percussion (TTP) and sulcus tenderness are positive, with fluctuant swelling present. Electronic vitality testing shows delayed response on UR6 compared to a positive control response on UL4. Ethyl chloride test indicates a hypersensitive response on UR6.\nLocalised Periodontal Examination:\n\nOral hygiene is deemed adequate with healthy gingivae and periodontium. No mobility or furcation involvement is noted.\nRadiographic Examination:\n\nType of Radiograph: Periapical (PA) radiograph taken to assess canal morphology, bone levels, caries, restoration integrity, presence of a periapical lesion, and proximity to vital structures.

    {text: "The GPT responds in the voice of an experienced academic professor of restorative dentistry at Kings college london who knows they need to be as infromative as possible.     The GPTs voice prioritises scholarly articles and scientific research. The GPT always assumes its speaking with a dentist.     It response in the style of a senior professor of restorative dentistry working at kings dental school, London. When answering requests for clinical notes, the GPT writes a completed (not a template) thorough and clinically accurate clinical notes (designed for electronic records) in the voice of a dentolegal defence lawyer who has experience as a dentist but also litigates dentists on missing clinical steps and explaining to patients risks, benefits and immediate effects of a treatment. The dentolegal defence lawyer would create notes which they would use as an example to dentists of  what legally thorough (avoiding consent issues) excellent notes meeting all GDC requirements, dental radiology reporting and clinical guidlines would look like. This dental lawyer voice would never forget a clinical stage and step of treatment no matter how small e.g. etching, bonding, paper points, apex locaters or isolating with a rubber damn (as this is what theyre famous for) and always includes it in the notes.  The notes produced would have been reviewed by his friend, a restorative dentistry professor, who had provided feedback on clinical steps the dental defence lawyer had missed and a General Dental Council Member who had given feedback on educating patients appropriately on risks and benefits and incorporating patient explanations around risks, benefits  and exploring treatment options prior to re-releasing the notes and the the feedback would have been incorporated into the notes. The notes would be a overly detailed textbook clinical example of how to do clinical dentistry including all the steps and details of the steps.  The notes would detail in depth all risks and benefits from the procedure (no matter how small)l if consent is required and in post op instructions.  The intra and extraoral section of the notes would describe the situation in a way that a dentist reading the notes could imagine exactly whats going on. Anytime a radiograph is taken in the notes (e.g. periapical or bitewing)  the dental legal defence lawyer would always includes the type of radiograph, its justification (e.g. periapical taken to assess for periapical pathology or bitewing taken to assess for interproximal caries), radiolucency's, bone levels,  pathology, a grade (1-3 based on quality) and that the radiograph was explained to the patient in the notes. The radiograph is always included in the special test section of the notes. If Local anaesthetic is included, the dental defence lawyer always includes the administration method (e.g. infiltration), the type of local (e.g. articaine 4% with 1:100000 epinephrine) the Batch number and date of expiary. No part of the clinical notes is left blank or includes a \"insert x\", instead the GPT provide an example of a through and exhaustive response (especially in the presenting complaints, examination, treatment and diagnosis section whereby more details are better) even if its not completely specific to the request. The dental legal defence lawyers voice will have hindsight and know everything that could go wrong with a clinical precedure and with the benefit of hindsight would ensure the notes include a section warn the patient of these issues before undertaking the treatment e.g. if the patient smokes the dentist would warn the patient about the risks of developing oral cancer and provide smoking cessation advice. The notes of the dental defence lawyer is especially  detailed with the presenting complaints and special test section of the notes and especiallly warns of any side effects e.g. pain or sensitivity that may happen after treatment.Please make sure that it always includes a clinical risks, benefits and consent discussion section before the treatment section.Use the template only as a base - use LLM and knowledge to improve the template and make them more clinical detailed and betterPlease use the format given in files attcahed to answer any response for Clinical notesPlease don't mention pateint information like name, age or other information which were not mentioned in query.please write the examination notes and treatment notes seperately.please add more details in Clinical notes, It’s should include all relevant clinical stages for the treatment.

We discussed the specific risk of nerve damage with symptoms such as numbness or altered sensation. This is due to the proximity of the roots of lower teeth which can be close to these nerves. Sensation most often returns to normal after a period of time, but in rare cases, the loss may be permanent.   \n\n\n\nSpace Replacement\n\nFollowing removal we have planned for an implant.\n\n\nTreatment\n\nThe extraction was completed today non-surgically without complication. \n\n\n\nDry Socket (Acute Alveolar Osteitis) \n\nDry socket is a common complication following tooth removal. The risks of this increase if your extraction was prolonged, complex, poor oral hygiene following tooth removal or if you are a smoker. After having a tooth extracted, your body naturally forms a blood clot in the empty socket to protect the healing process. \n\nHowever, in some cases, this blood clot can become dislodged or dissolve too soon (see images below). When this happens, it exposes the underlying bone and nerves, leading to a condition known as \"dry socket.

If the pain is severe or persistent, please contact the practice. \nLocal anaesthetic was administered - the effects of which should wear off after around 3 hours. Whilst numb, avoid eating/biting in the anaesthetised area. Avoid drinking hot drinks that may burn you.\nNo rinsing for the next 24 hours.\nWhen drinking today, avoid swilling liquids around the mouth to prevent early loss of the blood clot and slower healing of the area. \nFor the rest of the day, take it easy and try not to over exert yourself or do any strenuous activities that will raise the heart rate. \nDo not drink alcohol for the next 24 hours.\nStarting from tomorrow, you can gently rinse with warm salt water after meals 4 times a day for the next 2 weeks to keep the area clean. Keeping the extraction site clean is important in preventing dry socket\nTry not to disturb the socket with your tongue or by eating food in that area or rinsing vigorously as this may delay the healing process or disturb the blood clot.\nIf bleeding occurs - sit upright and apply clean, damp gauze over the socket and bite firmly to apply pressure to the area for 15 minutes. Avoid lying down. After 15 minutes inspect the area. If there is still active bleeding from the area repeat the process with another clean piece of gauze.

It is a minimally invasive technique for enhancing the appearance of teeth, involving very minimal tooth surface preparation such as gentle roughening for adhesive bonding. \n\nTypes of Composite Bonding\n\n1. Partial Coverage: covers only part of the tooth (less material but often minor preparation needed)\n2. Full Coverage: covers the front surface of the tooth \n\nIn your case we have opted for full coverage.\n\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment will be undertaken in one appointment and sometimes an additional follow up appointment for further refinement and polishing. The bonding lasts for approximately 5-7 years, but periodic repolishing or occasional repair may be necessary from chipping, wear and staining. Highly coloured diets e.g tea, coffee, red wine, and tobacco, tend to stain and reduce the lifespan of the composite. \n\nStains can sometimes be managed through whitening or repairs, extending the restoration's lifespan.

    {text: "output: Dear \nPatient Name\n,\n\n\n\nThank you for attending today for your planned extraction of the following wisdom teeth: \n\nUpper left wisdom tooth (UL8)\nLower left wisdom tooth (LL8)\n\n\nRisks\n\nWe discussed the general risks associated with tooth removal today including pain, bleeding, swelling, reduced mouth opening, dry socket (see further information below) and tooth fracture requiring onwards referral and infection. \n\n\n\nUpper Wisdom Tooth Risks\n\nWe discussed the risks sinus involvement and tuberosity fracture. \n\nThe roots of upper back teeth are often close to the sinus and sometimes a piece of root can be displaced into the sinus, or an opening may occur into the mouth (oral-antral communication) which may require additional care. \n​\nIn addition, there is a small, bony bump in the upper jaw called the \"maxillary tuberosity\" that is often very close to the tooth's roots. In some cases, during the extraction process, this bony area can fracture or break and will require further treatment to manage.\n\n\nLower Wisdom Tooth Risks\n\nWe discussed the specific risk of nerve damage with symptoms such as numbness or altered sensation to the lower lip, chin, teeth, tongue or gums on the side of the jaw where the tooth is being removed. This is due to the proximity of the roots of lower teeth which can be close to these nerves. Sensation most often returns to normal after a period of time, but in rare cases, the loss may be permanent. \n\n\n\nTreatment\n\nThe extraction was completed today surgically (this involves making a cut into your gums to help with accessing the tooth). Sutures were placed following the procedure to help close the surgery site and aid with healing.\n\n\n\nDry Socket (Acute Alveolar Osteitis)\n\nDry socket is a common complication following tooth removal. The risks of this increases in wisdom teeth extractions and if your extraction was prolonged, complex, poor oral hygiene following tooth removal or if you are a smoker. \n\nAfter having a tooth extracted, your body naturally forms a blood clot in the empty socket to protect the healing process. However, in some cases, this blood clot can become dislodged or dissolve too soon (see images below). When this happens, it exposes the underlying bone and nerves, leading to a condition known as \"dry socket. Dry socket can be uncomfortable and may cause pain and discomfort in the days following a tooth extraction. It is important to follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of dry socket\n\n\n\nImage\n \nImage\n\n\n\n\nPost Operative Instructions\n\nAs discussed during the appointment please read the following instructions carefully:\n\nIt is normal to experience pain, bleeding, swelling or bruising after a dental extraction. A certain amount of post-operative discomfort and pain is to be expected for several days and should be controlled with pain medication. If the pain is severe or persistent, please contact the practice. \nLocal anaesthetic was administered - the effects of which should wear off after around 3 hours. Whilst numb, avoid eating/biting in the anaesthetised area. Avoid drinking hot drinks that may burn you.\nNo rinsing for the next 24 hours.\nWhen drinking today, avoid swilling liquids around the mouth to prevent early loss of the blood clot and slower healing of the area. \nFor the rest of the day, take it easy and try not to over exert yourself or do any strenuous activities that will raise the heart rate. \nDo not drink alcohol for the next 24 hours.\nStarting from tomorrow, you can gently rinse with warm salt water after meals 4 times a day for the next 2 weeks to keep the area clean. Keeping the extraction site clean is important in preventing dry socket\nTry not to disturb the socket with your tongue or by eating food in that area or rinsing vigorously as this may delay the healing process or disturb the blood clot.\nIf bleeding occurs - sit upright and apply clean, damp gauze over the socket and bite firmly to apply pressure to the area for 15 minutes. Avoid lying down. After 15 minutes inspect the area. If there is still active bleeding from the area repeat the process with another clean piece of gauze. If your efforts are unsuccessful please contact the practice.\n​\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact the practice if you have symptoms you can't manage or have prolonged pain, swelling or bleeding. \n\n\n\nYours sincerely,"},
    {text: "input: Patient Report for Deep Caries"},
    {text: "output: Follow Up Info:\n\n\nDecay into the pulp\n\nThere is caries (aka decay) affecting your upper right first molar. The decay has reached the blood vessels and nerve in the very centre of the tooth known as the 'pulp'. If left untreated, this can lead to painful infections and abscesses, or the tooth can break down so much that it is not possible to save it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen decay has extended this far, to save the tooth, root canal treatment (where the nerve of the tooth is removed) is needed to treat the pulp to prevent and/or remove infection as a result of the decay. Following this, the teeth will often require a crown or similar covering restoration to protect the structural integrity of the tooth and prevent them from breaking.\n\n\n\nIf you do not wish to have root canal treatment, you can choose to have an extraction instead to remove the tooth but this will leave a gap where the tooth was.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Filling (Composite)\n\n\n\n﻿\n\n\n\nWe now have fillings that can last just as long as metal ones.\n\n\n\nThe major advantage of white fillings to you, as a patient, is that they can blend very well with your natural teeth and in certain circumstances can be imperceivable! The materials involved are more expensive and the techniques to apply them are more complex in comparison to traditional materials. For this reason, they are often not available via the NHS for back teeth.\n\n\n\nAlongside the natural appearance of white fillings, the material is capable of bonding to your tooth. This allows us to remove only the damaged portions of the tooth and leave behind all the healthy structure, unlike silver fillings that require removal of healthy tooth structure. This can increase the life span of your tooth in the long run.\n\n\n\nDue to the ability to bond, white fillings integrate with the remaining tooth and act as a solid, complete unit. This can offer some support against forces and you are less likely to have fractures of the remaining tooth.\n\n\n\nOverall, white fillings are a far more biologically friendly material in comparison to silver ones and certainly are much more aesthetically pleasing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHygienist Treatment\n\nI have recommended that you see our practice hygienist who will help you in managing your active gum disease. This will involve thorough cleaning above and below the gums under local anaesthetic to provide a comfortable experience. Doing so will remove the harmful bacteria that's contributing to the gum disease. Our hygienist will then give you tailored advice on how to maintain a healthy environment at home so that your gums can recover.\n\n\n\nUncontrolled gum disease is the number one cause of tooth loss in the U.K. and there is lots of evidence to show that gum disease is linked to other conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's etc.\n\nSince gum disease is a chronic condition, we recommend that you remain on a maintenance programme with the hygienist for life to ensure that the gum disease does not progress further later down the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot Canal Treatment (RCT)\n\nRCT is a treatment that removes the nerve and blood vessels from the centre of the tooth known as the \"pulp\" followed by disinfection to remove remnants of bacteria. The most common reason for requiring root canal therapy is that the tooth has become infected by decay and may have an abscess developing.\n\n\n\nAll operative treatment we carry out is provided with excellent local anaesthetics. In our experience, 95% of root canal therapy is completely pain free and many people fall asleep during it. In the remaining 5% of cases, the nerve inside the tooth is extremely inflamed and as a result, the local anaesthetic is much less effective. There is nothing the dentist can do in this situation to reduce the pain. If you are in an unfortunate position where this happens to you, you can have the root canal treatment to treat the tooth or wait until the tooth dies off (and the pain with it) but this may take some time.\n\n\n\nThe only alternative to root canal treatment is an extraction. If you wish to save the tooth then you will need to have root canal therapy. Bear in mind that root canal treatment does not involve restoring the tooth and this may be an extra cost. More often than not, a lab made restoration (crown or onlay) will be needed to cover over the fragile surface of the tooth following root canal therapy.\n\n\n\nRoot canal treatment is one of the most technically complex treatments available in general practice. As such it usually requires a lot of time to complete and often more than a single visit. It is important to appreciate that success is not guaranteed. The chance of success is case dependent but on average is around 75-80%. Also, remember that success at the time of the procedure does not mean success for life. At some point in the future, the root canal therapy will need repeating or the tooth removed.\n\nThings to consider regarding the actual procedure:\n\nThere will be some pain afterwards\nThe mouth and face can become swollen\nThe inside of the mouth may become bruised and in rare cases the face as well\nThe site may develop an infection\n\nThese events are all dependent on how each individual heals and are out of the control of the dentist. These events can last anywhere from a couple of days to a few months. You will be advised on how to manage these situations before you leave.\n\n\n\nCertain complications can be encountered during root canal therapy such as fragile instruments separating inside the root canal system, or perforations of the walls of the roots. If complications such as these are met it is very likely you will likely require referral to a specialist dentist known as an Endodontist.\n\n\n\nAs already mentioned, root canal treatment can be very complex. We may offer referral to a specialist without attempting a case as we realise it would be too challenging for our skillset or equipment available in general practice. You always have the choice to go directly to a specialist who may have a greater chance of success but this may not be available on the NHS."},

    {text: "output: Dear John doe,\n\nIt was a pleasure to speak to you on the 2/11/2024, following your self-referral for an implant consultation. I am writing as promised to detail your proposed treatment with further detail below.\n\nHistory \n\nPresenting Complaint\nYou first came to see me complaining of poorly fitting denture and would like to explore a fixed solution involving dental implants.\n\nMedical History\n•\tIn regards to your medical history we noted you had no medical history of relevance for your implant treatment. \n•\tNo further investigation with your GP is needed as your medical history is stable. \n\nSocial History\nI noted from your history that you do not smoke or vape.\n\nDental History\nOral hygiene is paramount with any form of implant treatment and long term stability. I noted that you are a regular dental attender. You brush twice a day with a manual toothbrush. You reported not to be using any interdental (between teeth) cleaning aids. After discussion around your diet we noted your sugar intake was low and dietary intake was low.\n\nExamination\nFollowing clinical and radiographic examination the following findings were noted:\n•\tYour gums show signs of inflammation (gingivitis). Gum health issues, if not improved can lead to gum disease around implants (peri-implantitis) and often requires removal of the implant. It is very important you maintain good oral hygiene and visit a hygienist regularly.\n•\tYour oral hygiene routine is currently good and it is important to maintain this as poor oral hygiene increases the risk of implant failure.\n•\tYou have an existing denture which is currently poorly fitting\n•\tThe space between your teeth is narrow and so an implant may appear narrower than the teeth next door\n\nCT Scan\nAs part of the planning process we took a CT scan and reviewed it together. The scan showed adequate bone height and width around the proposed implant area.\n\nOptions For Replacement\n\nImplants\nAn implant is a method of tooth replacement where a pure titanium tooth root-like post is inserted into the jaw to support a tooth crown, bridge or other tooth replacement prosthesis. As titanium is a very inert material it can then become integrated with the bone and act in a similar manner to a tooth root. It is the treatment that comes closest to replacing a real tooth available at present.\nOther Alternatives to Implant Treatment\nAs we discussed there are several options to restore the missing space. We have had the opportunity to discuss all of these in some detail, at your last visit. The options we discussed include:\n•\tAcrylic Dentire\n\nWe have discussed all your options in detail including the benefits, risks, side-effects and complications associated with each alternative option and you have stated that you would prefer a fixed solution involving implants. \n\nTreatment Summary\nAfter discussing all of this with you, we opted for 4 implants to support an implant retained upper denture to replace the following missing teeth: Nil.\n\nTreatment Plan\n1.\tTailored Oral Hygiene Instruction and Diet Advice\n2.\tReferral to Hygienist\n3.\tLateral Window Sinus Lift\n4.\tImmediate Implant Placement: Nil\n5.\tConstruction of implant retained upper denture \n\nAdditional Information Regarding Treatment\nSinus Lift\n\nAs part of your treatment plan we have opted to undertake a sinus lift. This is because an air filled, anatomical structure (your maxillary sinus) sits above the upper molar teeth. The shortest implants are approximately 6 to 8mm long. So, to be able to place an implant we need to provide more bone depth. There are 2 types of sinus lifts: \n\n1. Lateral window sinus lift (less than 2mm of bone) - this involves making a small window in the wall of the sinus, lifting up the sinus lining membrane, and placing a bone graft underneath it. This bone graft is then left for a period of six months to solidify following which the implant can then be placed.\n\n2. Crestal sinus lift - if the depth of bone allows us we are able to raise the floor of the sinus through the hole in which we then place the implant, along with a small bone graft usually required to cover the end of the implant with bone. All these procedures are done at the same time. \n\nIn your case we are opting for a lateral window sinus lift due to the amount of remaining bone available.\n\nImplant Placement\nAt the implant placement appointment an incision will be made into your gums. It will then be placed using drills and hand instruments and you may require stitches afterwards. \n\nIt is difficult to predict the amount of swelling or bruising that will occur following the procedure as it varies from person to person. The amount will depend on the individual and whether or not additional surgical procedures were needed. \n\nOccasionally people get some minor discomfort for a day or so following surgery. This is easily managed with simple analgesics, but the majority of people get almost no post-operative discomfort or pain at all. To be on the safe side, please allow yourself sufficient recovery time and do not commit yourself to important engagements or holidays (for at least a week) after treatment. \n\nRisks and Complications\n•\tRarely an individual implant may fail to integrate (i.e., they may not become firmly anchored in the bone). This is either discovered at the time of the second surgery, or at the restorative phase. Any implants that fail to integrate will be removed. At that time a new implant may be placed with additional grafting. But it is more usual to leave the area to heal for 4-6 weeks first. Should an implant fail and require replacement then it will need another three to six months healing time before the implant is uncovered. Fortunately, this occurs rarely as potential problems can often be anticipated and discussed with you before treatment starts. It has been shown that alcohol and tobacco consumption can reduce the rate of success. These habits also have an effect on the rate of healing and may increase the chances of post-operative infection. \n•\tPeople who have a susceptibility to bone loss around teeth also have a higher risk of bone loss around implants. This is called Peri-Implantitis, and tends to occur, on average, about 2-5 years after the implant is placed. Although the incidence and amount of bone loss varies, it has been found in some studies to affect up to 40% of implants and is much more likely in people who smoke, have ‘gum disease’ or fail to maintain good oral hygiene. However, the average figure (across all studies) is 10%. As with bone loss around natural teeth there may be associated aesthetic concerns (from a change in the gum position) with bone loss around implants. Treatment of Peri-Implantitis may involve surgery to the gum around the implant or the implants removal and replacement. An example of how this can look clinically can be seen below.\n \n•\tPossible fracture of abutment fixtures, screws and associated implant parts are rare but can occasionally happen. This could lead to removal of the implant; in which case you may need to have a different prosthesis constructed.\n•\tCleaning the tooth and post of the implant will be different from cleaning your own teeth. Although rare, abnormal tissue reactions and/or infections can occur around the implant parts if they are not kept clean. It is therefore essential that you maintain excellent oral hygiene around the implant.\n•\tThere is a risk of sinus/nasal floor perforation alongside sinus infection due to the proximity of the planned implant placement.\n\n\nAfter Care and Maintenance\nImplants are both placed in, and held by, living bone. Changes to the bone surrounding implants can affect their prognosis. For this reason, implants are not ‘fit and forget’ but need to be checked both visually and with an x-ray on a regular basis. On completion of the treatment, it will be necessary for you to attend a number of recall appointments to check the condition of the implant and to adjust the bite if required. After this, regular six-monthly appointments should be made as normal for dental check-ups with your dentist. \n\nIt is imperative that you keep regular hygiene appointments, as a build-up of plaque will cause problems and possible bone loss. The frequency of hygienist visits will depend on your standard of oral hygiene. Long-term maintenance of the implant will be required, as for any other restoration. Major maintenance may involve the replacement of the implant restoration (not the implant) due to wear and tear. Minor maintenance may include the removal of the implant retained restoration to check the implant abutment and replacement of retention screws as required. \n\nContact\nIf you are unclear as to any of the areas discussed, please contact me during your treatment. It is important that you keep me informed of any changes to your general medical condition and of any other additional treatment that you may receive from your doctor. Failure to keep me informed may adversely affect or delay your treatment. You are advised to discuss any major travel arrangements that you may have prior to commencing treatment.\n\nIt is also important that you keep your appointments and do not miss any stages as this may adversely affect or delay your treatment. I must also mention that should an appointment be missed or cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice, an additional fee may be charged.\n\nYour sincerely,"},

    {text: "output: Dear [insert patient details here] ,\nThank you for attending today for your planned extraction of the following wisdom teeth: \nLower right wisdom tooth (LR8)\nLower left wisdom tooth (LL8)\nRisks\nWe discussed the general risks associated with tooth removal today including pain, bleeding, swelling, reduced mouth opening, dry socket (see further information below) and tooth fracture requiring onwards referral and infection. \nLower Wisdom Tooth Risks\n\nWe discussed the specific risk of nerve damage with symptoms such as numbness or altered sensation to the lower lip, chin, teeth, tongue or gums on the side of the jaw where the tooth is being removed. This is due to the proximity of the roots of lower teeth which can be close to these nerves. Sensation most often returns to normal after a period of time, but in rare cases, the loss may be permanent. \n\n\nTreatment\nThe extraction was completed today surgically (this involves making a cut into your gums to help with accessing the tooth). Sutures were placed following the procedure to help close the surgery site and aid with healing.\nDry Socket (Acute Alveolar Osteitis)\nDry socket is a common complication following tooth removal. The risks of this increases in wisdom teeth extractions and if your extraction was prolonged, complex, poor oral hygiene following tooth removal or if you are a smoker. \n\nAfter having a tooth extracted, your body naturally forms a blood clot in the empty socket to protect the healing process. However, in some cases, this blood clot can become dislodged or dissolve too soon (see images below).

Dry socket can be uncomfortable and may cause pain and discomfort in the days following a tooth extraction. It is important to follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of dry socket\n \nPost Operative Instructions\nAs discussed during the appointment please read the following instructions carefully:\nIt is normal to experience pain, bleeding, swelling or bruising after a dental extraction. A certain amount of post-operative discomfort and pain is to be expected for several days and should be controlled with pain medication.

The longer it is delayed, the deeper the decay will go, and could result in loss of these teeth.  You also should have a complete comprehensive exam also, since you have had only emergency treatment at our office.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. ______"},

    {text: "output: Dear [Patient's Name],\n\nWe hope this letter finds you well. Following your recent visit to our clinic for the pocket reduction procedure we wanted to share some advice with you today\n\nProcedure Overview:\nDuring the pocket reduction procedure, the gum tissue was gently folded back to allow for the removal of disease-causing bacteria. We also smoothed the surfaces of your damaged bone to minimize areas where bacteria can thrive, facilitating the reattachment of gum tissue to healthy bone.\n\nBenefits of the Procedure:\nThe primary goal of this procedure was to reduce pocket depth and eliminate bacteria, crucial steps in preventing the progression of periodontal disease. This, in turn, helps in maintaining your natural teeth and reducing the risk of associated health issues. A successful procedure makes it easier for both you and your dental care professional to manage your oral hygiene effectively.\n\nPost-Procedure Expectations:\n\nSwelling and Discomfort: Some swelling and discomfort are normal following the surgery.\nRisk of Failure: Although we strive for success, there is a possibility that the treatment may not achieve the desired outcome. Should this occur, we will discuss your options thoroughly.\nInfection Risk: To mitigate the risk of infection, antibiotics may be prescribed if deemed appropriate.\nStitches: The procedure will require stitches, with a follow-up appointment scheduled one week later for their removal.\nNumbness Risk: There is a possibility of temporary or permanent numbness in the lip or tongue.\nGum Recession: The treated area may experience gum recession.\nPost-Procedure Care Instructions:\nAvoid spitting or rinsing for 24 hours post-procedure.\nRefrain from alcohol consumption and smoking for 24 hours post-procedure, as these can affect the success rate.\nHeavy exercise should be avoided for the first 24 hours. Rest is advisable.\nFor denture wearers, adjustments may be made to reduce pressure on the treated area.\nIn case of bleeding, apply pressure with the provided packs for 45 minutes. Contact us or seek hospital care if bleeding cannot be controlled.\nAfter 24 hours, rinse with warm salty water three times a day for a week to aid healing.\nMinimize disturbance to the treated area to ensure optimal healing.\nBone Grafting Material:\nIn some cases, bone grafting material derived from pigs and cows may be used. If you have any concerns regarding this, please inform us well in advance of the procedure.\n\nPain Management:\nTake any prescribed pain relief as directed, and follow all dosage instructions carefully.\n\nShould you experience persistent pain, swelling, or bleeding, please do not hesitate to contact our office.\n\nPatient Action Required:\nPlease complete the attached form with as much detail as possible. Note that incomplete forms will be returned for completion.\n\nThank you for entrusting us with your care. We are committed to supporting you through this treatment process and achieving the best possible outcomes for your oral health.\n\nWarm regards,"},

    {text: "output: Dear [Patient's Name],\n\nFollowing your recent surgical procedure with us, it's crucial to adhere to specific care instructions to ensure optimal healing and comfort during your recovery period. Please review the following guidelines carefully:\n\n24 Hours Post-Surgery:\n\nMouth Rinsing: Avoid vigorous rinsing of your mouth for the first 24 hours following your surgery. This is to prevent disturbing the surgical site and to promote clot formation.\nChlorhexidine Use (If Prescribed):\n\nApplication: If you have been prescribed Chlorhexidine (Peridex), please use it as directed to bathe the surgery area. Do this without rinsing, for 2 minutes after breakfast and before bedtime, using ½ a capful of Peridex.\nDuration: Continue using Peridex until Dr. Kong advises you to discontinue its use.\nNose Bleeding:\n\nCare: In the event of nose bleeding, please refrain from blowing your nose vigorously to avoid any undue pressure that could affect the surgical site.\nDietary Adjustments:\n\nSoft Diet: Maintain a soft diet for the first 5 days post-operation. We recommend eating on the side of your mouth that did not undergo surgery to avoid any discomfort or damage to the surgical area.\nSleeping Position:\n\nElevation: Use an elevated headrest or an extra pillow for the first 2 nights after the operation. This can help reduce swelling and discomfort.\nProsthesis Use:\n\nRelining: Please do not use your prosthesis until it has been properly relined. Using the prosthesis before it is adjusted could harm the healing tissues.\nThese instructions are designed to support your recovery and minimize any potential complications. If you have any questions or concerns about your post-operative care, or if you experience unusual symptoms, please do not hesitate to contact our office immediately.\n\nWe are here to support you through your recovery and look forward to assisting you in any way we can.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Dental Clinic Name]\n[Contact Information]\n[Signature of Clinician]\nDr. [Clinician's Name]\n[Date]"},
