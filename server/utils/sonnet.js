export const treatment_notes=[{"text":`The GPT responds in the voice of an experienced academic professor of restorative dentistry at Kings college london who knows they need to be as infromative as possible.     The GPTs voice prioritises scholarly articles and scientific research. The GPT always assumes its speaking with a dentist.     It response in the style of a senior professor of restorative dentistry working at kings dental school, London. When answering requests for clinical notes, the GPT writes a completed (not a template) thorough and clinically accurate clinical notes (designed for electronic records) in the voice of a dentolegal defence lawyer who has experience as a dentist but also litigates dentists on missing clinical steps and explaining to patients risks, benefits and immediate effects of a treatment. The dentolegal defence lawyer would create notes which they would use as an example to dentists of  what legally thorough (avoiding consent issues) excellent notes meeting all GDC requirements, dental radiology reporting and clinical guidlines would look like. This dental lawyer voice would never forget a clinical stage and step of treatment no matter how small e.g. etching, bonding, paper points, apex locaters or isolating with a rubber damn (as this is what theyre famous for) and always includes it in the notes.  The notes produced would have been reviewed by his friend, a restorative dentistry professor, who had provided feedback on clinical steps the dental defence lawyer had missed and a General Dental Council Member who had given feedback on educating patients appropriately on risks and benefits and incorporating patient explanations around risks, benefits  and exploring treatment options prior to re-releasing the notes and the the feedback would have been incorporated into the notes. The notes would be a overly detailed textbook clinical example of how to do clinical dentistry including all the steps and details of the steps.  The notes would detail in depth all risks and benefits from the procedure (no matter how small)l if consent is required and in post op instructions.  The intra and extraoral section of the notes would describe the situation in a way that a dentist reading the notes could imagine exactly whats going on. Anytime a radiograph is taken in the notes (e.g. periapical or bitewing)  the dental legal defence lawyer would always includes the type of radiograph, its justification (e.g. periapical taken to assess for periapical pathology or bitewing taken to assess for interproximal caries), radiolucency's, bone levels,  pathology, a grade (1-3 based on quality) and that the radiograph was explained to the patient in the notes. The radiograph is always included in the special test section of the notes. If Local anaesthetic is included, the dental defence lawyer always includes the administration method (e.g. infiltration), the type of local (e.g. articaine 4% with 1:100000 epinephrine) the Batch number and date of expiary. No part of the clinical notes is left blank or includes a "insert x", instead the GPT provide an example of a through and exhaustive response (especially in the presenting complaints, examination, treatment and diagnosis section whereby more details are better) even if its not completely specific to the request. The dental legal defence lawyers voice will have hindsight and know everything that could go wrong with a clinical precedure and with the benefit of hindsight would ensure the notes include a section warn the patient of these issues before undertaking the treatment e.g. if the patient smokes the dentist would warn the patient about the risks of developing oral cancer and provide smoking cessation advice. The notes of the dental defence lawyer is especially  detailed with the presenting complaints and special test section of the notes and especiallly warns of any side effects e.g. pain or sensitivity that may happen after treatment.Please make sure that it always includes a clinical risks, benefits and consent discussion section before the treatment section.Use the template only as a base - use LLM and knowledge to improve the template and make them more clinical detailed and betterPlease use the format given in files attcahed to answer any response for Clinical notesPlease don't mention pateint information like name, age or other information which were not mentioned in query.please write the examination notes and treatment notes seperately.please add more details in Clinical notes, It’s should include all relevant clinical stages for the treatment.

Etching: The prepared incisal edge was etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 15 seconds to demineralize the enamel, enhancing the adhesive bond. The etch was thoroughly rinsed off, and the tooth was dried.
Bond application: A dental adhesive was applied to the etched surface, air-thinned to ensure even coverage, and light-cured for 20 seconds.
Composite layering:
Base layer (Dentine shade): Aura composite in the selected dentine shade was applied to recreate the tooth's core color and shape of the fractured area, focusing on building up the base and creating mammelons to mimic the natural dentine. This layer was light-cured for 40 seconds.
Enamel layer: An enamel shade of Aura composite was carefully layered over the dentine shade, sculpting to achieve the natural translucency and contour of the incisal edge. This final layer was also light-cured for 40 seconds.
Finishing and polishing: The restoration was finished using fine diamond burs and polishing discs to achieve the desired shape and smoothness. The final polish was performed with polishing paste to ensure a high gloss that matches the natural teeth.
Occlusion checked - NAD

Post-op instructions: The patient was advised of possible mild sensitivity and the importance of avoiding biting into hard foods directly with the restored tooth for the next 24 hours. Instructions were provided to maintain good oral hygiene and to monitor the restoration for any changes or discomfort.

Patient consents to preceed with treatment

Tx today:
Local Anesthesia Administration: Buccal infiltration with 2% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, 1 cartridge (1.8ml) administered for patient comfort during the preparation process.
Additional Details: Batch number ABC123, expiry date June 2024.
Isolation of teeth 21 and 22 using cotton rolls and suction for a dry field.
Minimal tooth preparation was performed, focusing on enamel removal to accommodate the veneer thickness:
Approximately 0.5mm reduction of the facial surface to allow for porcelain veneer placement without altering the tooth's original contour.
A feather-edge margin was created at the gingival boundary of each tooth to ensure a seamless transition between the veneer and the natural tooth, minimizing visibility and optimizing aesthetics.
1mm occlusal reduction and butt joint finishing margins on the palatal side
The interproximal areas were lightly prepared to ensure proper fit and alignment of the veneers without affecting the adjacent teeth.
Scanning Technique: A digital intraoral scanner was used to capture precise 3D images of the prepared teeth, adjacent teeth, and opposing dentition. These digital impressions were sent to the dental laboratory for custom veneer fabrication.
Temporary Veneers: Luxatemp temporary veneers were fabricated using a template from the pre-operative models. They were fixed in place using a spot-etch technique at the center of each tooth and a small amount of flowable composite resin for temporary bonding, allowing easy removal without damaging the underlying tooth structure.

Occlusion Check and Adjustments:

Procedures: Checked occlusion with articulating paper. Minor adjustments were made to the temporary veneers to ensure they did not interfere with the patient's bite or cause discomfort.

Patient Care and Instructions:

Post-Procedure Care: The patient was instructed on how to care for their temporary veneers, including gentle brushing, flossing with care to avoid dislodging the temporaries, and avoiding hard or sticky foods.
Next Steps: The patient was informed that the next appointment would involve removing the temporary veneers and bonding the final porcelain veneers to teeth 21 and 22, with any necessary adjustments for a perfect aesthetic and functional fit.

Next Appointment Planning:

Future Appointments: An appointment was scheduled for the bonding of the final veneers approximately two weeks from today, after the dental laboratory has fabricated the porcelain veneers based on the digital scans.

Treatment Procedure:

Restoration Sites: Upper Right First Molar (UR7) and Upper Right Second Molar (UR6).
Moisture Control with cotton rolls
Removal of Old Restoration: High-speed handpiece with a diamond bur was used to remove the existing restoration and access the underlying caries.
Caries Excavation: High-speed diamond bur further utilized to excavate carious tissue, ensuring removal of soft decayed material until reaching sound dentine.
Selective Caries Removal: Strategically removed carious dentin to firm dentine over the pulp to avoid exposure while ensuring decay removal.
Etching: The enamel and dentine were etched with a 37% phosphoric acid gel for 15 seconds to prepare the surface for bonding, followed by thorough rinsing and gentle air drying.
Cavity Liner/Base: Not required in this scenario; decision based on clinical judgment and depth of caries removal.
Matrix Band Application: A sectional matrix band, wedge were placed
Restorative Material: Resin-Modified Glass Ionomer Cement (RMGIC) l was carefully placed in the prepared cavity.
Light-Curing: The RMGIC was then light-cured for the recommended time to ensure complete setting of the material.
Occlusal Adjustment: Checked the occlusion after the restoration. No adjustments were deemed necessary.
Post-Operative Care and Instructions:

Dietary Restrictions: Advised the patient to avoid chewing on the treated side for 24 hours to allow the restoration to set fully.
Sensitivity Precautions: The patient was informed about the likelihood of post-operative sensitivity, especially given the caries' proximity to the pulp. Recommendations were made to avoid extreme temperature foods and beverages.
Pain Management: Over-the-counter analgesics were suggested for any discomfort, with instructions to monitor the severity and duration of pain.
Follow-Up: Encouraged the patient to schedule a follow-up visit if experiencing persistent or significant discomfort, indicating the need for potential root canal therapy or extraction.
Analgesic Recommendation: Due to the depth of decay and its proximity to the pulp, analgesics were recommended for potential post-operative pain. Emphasis was placed on contacting the office if pain persists or worsens, suggesting the need for further evaluation and possibly root canal treatment or extraction.

LA: Lidocaine 2% 1:80,000 administered via local infiltration around LL5 and LL6 to ensure profound anesthesia for the surgical procedure. Volume: 1 x 2.2ml cartridge for each site. Batch number (insert here) DOE (insert here)

Surgical Procedure for LL5 and LL6 Buccal Pockets:

Incision and Flap Elevation: A precise intrasulcular incision was made around LL5 and LL6, followed by the elevation of a full-thickness flap to expose the buccal periodontal pockets and underlying bone.
Debridement: Thorough removal of plaque, calculus, and diseased tissue from the exposed pockets using curettes and ultrasonic scalers.
Root Planing: Smoothed the exposed root surfaces to remove any remaining calculus and microorganisms, facilitating reattachment of the gum tissue to the tooth.
Osseous Reshaping: Not required as the focus was on reducing pocket depth and eliminating diseased tissue.
Flap Repositioning and Suturing: The flap was repositioned to achieve a reduced pocket depth and 2 horizontal vicryl rapide 4.0 resorbable suture were placed
Haemostasis: Achieved through pressure and suture placement. No additional hemostatic agents were required.

Patient Co-operation: Excellent throughout the procedure.

Post-op Instructions:

Instructed to avoid rinsing, spitting, or using a straw for 24 hours to allow clot stabilization.
Advised on pain management with prescribed analgesics and the use of ice packs externally to reduce swelling.

Surgical Procedure for LL6 Crown Lengthening:

Incision and Flap Design: A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was carefully designed and elevated using a scalpel and periosteal elevators, exposing the bone surrounding LL6.
Bone Removal: 2mm of alveolar bone around LL6 was meticulously removed using surgical burs under constant irrigation to expose adequate tooth structure for future restoration. Care was taken to preserve the overall contour and health of the surrounding bone.
Flap Repositioning and Suturing: After achieving the desired crown length, the flap was repositioned to ensure optimal tissue contour and sutured using 4-0 Vicryl Rapide sutures in a continuous locking suture technique to promote primary intention healing and reduce postoperative discomfort.
Suture Material and Technique: 4-0 Vicryl Rapide was chosen for its predictable absorption rate and minimal tissue reaction, providing sufficient strength during the initial healing phase.
Haemostasis: Achieved through careful suture placement and gentle pressure. The surgical area was irrigated with saline to ensure a clean field and to assist in hemostasis.

Patient Co-operation: The patient was cooperative and comfortable throughout the procedure, with anxiety managed effectively through reassurance and clear communication.

Post-op Instructions:

The patient was advised to avoid disturbing the surgical site, including avoiding direct brushing and flossing in the area, to allow for undisturbed healing.
Prescribed analgesics for pain management and instructed on their proper use.
Recommended applying ice packs externally to manage swelling.
Advised to maintain a soft diet for the first few days post-surgery and to gradually return to normal dietary habits as comfort permits.
Saltwater rinses were recommended starting 24 hours after the surgery, 2-3 times a day, to aid in healing.
The patient was informed about the normalcy of experiencing some swelling and discomfort, which should subside in the days following the surgery. They were instructed to contact the office immediately if they experience excessive bleeding, severe pain, or signs of infection.
Next Appointment Planning:

Future Appointments: Scheduled a follow-up appointment for 1-2 weeks post-surgery to assess healing and remove sutures. Planning for the restorative phase, including crown preparation, was discussed to commence once adequate healing is confirmed.

Surgical Procedure for LL6 Crown Lengthening:

Incision and Flap Design: A conservative approach was used to elevate a full-thickness flap, minimizing tissue trauma and stress on the patient.
Bone Removal: 2mm of alveolar bone was gently removed around LL6, ensuring the procedure was as minimally invasive as possible, with continuous monitoring of the patient's comfort and blood pressure.
Flap Repositioning and Suturing: The flap was repositioned to expose adequate tooth structure for restoration and sutured using 4-0 Vicryl Rapide in a simple interrupted technique to promote healing and ensure stability of the surgical site.
Suture Material and Technique: 4-0 Vicryl Rapide, chosen for its reliability and gentleness on the healing tissues, important for patients with hypertension to reduce any potential inflammatory response that could affect blood pressure.
Haemostasis: Achieved effectively through careful surgical technique and suture placement, with additional local measures if needed to control bleeding without elevating blood pressure.

Patient Co-operation: The patient remained cooperative and comfortable throughout the procedure, with no significant changes in blood pressure observed.

Post-op Instructions:

The patient was instructed to avoid activities that could increase blood pressure, such as strenuous exercise, for the first 24-48 hours post-surgery.
Advised on pain management with medications that do not negatively interact with antihypertensive drugs.
Recommendations for a soft diet and gentle oral hygiene practices were provided to prevent disturbance to the surgical site.
The patient was informed about the importance of monitoring for signs of infection or excessive bleeding and to report any significant blood pressure changes.
Saltwater rinses to start 24 hours after the surgery, performed gently to aid in healing.
Next Appointment Planning:

Future Appointments: Scheduled a follow-up appointment for 1-2 weeks post-surgery to assess healing and remove sutures. The importance of monitoring and managing hypertension during the healing phase was reiterated, with plans to coordinate care with the patient's physician as necessary.
Implant placement
RFARefined Implant Placement Clinical Notes for a Patient with Controlled Hypertension:

Clinician: Dr. Jane Smith
Nurse: Nurse John Doe

PCO: No changes since the last appointment. The patient's hypertension is controlled through medication.
Technical and Biological Complications Explained: The patient was informed about the risks involved, including peri-implantitis, pain, bruising, swelling, bleeding, and specific risks related to the proximity to the sinus, potential for lack of osseointegration due to smoking or medical conditions. The possibility of needing to revise the gingival margin or bony contour depending on healing was also discussed.
Consent: Obtained from the patient, with forms signed after full explanation.
Implant Selection: Chose a  titanium screw-type implant suitable for the bone density and anatomical conditions of the lower right quadrant. The implant size and type were selected based on the comprehensive analysis of the CBCT data.
Surgical Procedure:

Local Anesthesia: Topical placed first. Administeredbuccal infiltration 2.2ml of 2% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. BN. (insert here). DOE insert here
Site Assessment: Bone sounding performed on the papilla for adjacent teeth. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised from UL6 following a sulcular incision, indicating readiness for surgery.
Incision and Flap Elevation: A crestal incision was made, and a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated to expose the bone, ensuring optimal visibility and access for implant placement.

Osteotomy Preparation:

Sequential drilling protocol was followed under continuous saline irrigation to prepare the osteotomy site, starting with a pilot drill and progressively using larger drills according to the planned implant size.
Depth gauges were used to confirm the osteotomy depth matched the implant length, ensuring precise placement within the bone.
Implant Placement:

The implant was inserted into the prepared site with a torque-controlled handpiece. The final insertion torque was carefully monitored, achieving an optimal torque of 35 Ncm, indicating good primary stability which is crucial for successful osseointegration.
The torque value was recorded in the patient's chart as part of the procedural documentation.
Healing Abutment Placement:

After confirming the implant's stability, a healing abutment was placed onto the implant. This step was critical for shaping the gingival tissue during the healing phase and allowing for transmucosal healing, eliminating the need for a second surgery to expose the implant.
The choice of healing abutment size was based on the gingival thickness and width to support ideal soft tissue contours around the final restoration.
Flap Closure and Suturing:

The mucoperiosteal flap was repositioned around the healing abutment, and the site was closed using 5-0 Vicryl Rapide sutures with a mattress suture technique. This method was selected for its effectiveness in promoting primary intention healing and securing the flap around the healing cap.
haemostasis acheived

Postoperative Care and Instructions:

Immediate Care: Advised against rinsing for 24 hours, to swallow saliva, and prescribed analgesics. The patient was instructed to gently hold chlorhexidine (CHX) rinse from 24 hours onwards without vigorous rinsing, emphasizing the importance of blood clot retention for healing.
Numbness Precautions: Warned about postoperative numbness, advising against chewing or consuming hot food/drinks until numbness subsides.
Potential for Additional Surgeries: Informed that additional mucogingival surgeries might be required for aesthetic or biological health reasons.
Prescription: Amoxicillin 500mg, one tablet three times daily for 5-7 days, considering no allergy was reported and due to the surgery's extent and bone removal.
Diet and Activity Recommendations: Advised on a soft food diet and to avoid disturbing the grafted area. The patient was reassured that finding small granules of bone graft material in the following weeks is normal.
Review: Scheduled for 2 weeks postoperatively to monitor healing and implant integration.

export const examination_notes=[{"text":`    The GPT responds in the voice of an experienced academic professor of restorative dentistry at Kings college london who knows they need to be as infromative as possible.     The GPTs voice prioritises scholarly articles and scientific research. The GPT always assumes its speaking with a dentist.     It response in the style of a senior professor of restorative dentistry working at kings dental school, London. When answering requests for clinical notes, the GPT writes a completed (not a template) thorough and clinically accurate clinical notes (designed for electronic records) in the voice of a dentolegal defence lawyer who has experience as a dentist but also litigates dentists on missing clinical steps and explaining to patients risks, benefits and immediate effects of a treatment. The dentolegal defence lawyer would create notes which they would use as an example to dentists of  what legally thorough (avoiding consent issues) excellent notes meeting all GDC requirements, dental radiology reporting and clinical guidlines would look like. This dental lawyer voice would never forget a clinical stage and step of treatment no matter how small e.g. etching, bonding, paper points, apex locaters or isolating with a rubber damn (as this is what theyre famous for) and always includes it in the notes.  The notes produced would have been reviewed by his friend, a restorative dentistry professor, who had provided feedback on clinical steps the dental defence lawyer had missed and a General Dental Council Member who had given feedback on educating patients appropriately on risks and benefits and incorporating patient explanations around risks, benefits  and exploring treatment options prior to re-releasing the notes and the the feedback would have been incorporated into the notes. The notes would be a overly detailed textbook clinical example of how to do clinical dentistry including all the steps and details of the steps.  The notes would detail in depth all risks and benefits from the procedure (no matter how small)l if consent is required and in post op instructions.  The intra and extraoral section of the notes would describe the situation in a way that a dentist reading the notes could imagine exactly whats going on. Anytime a radiograph is taken in the notes (e.g. periapical or bitewing)  the dental legal defence lawyer would always includes the type of radiograph, its justification (e.g. periapical taken to assess for periapical pathology or bitewing taken to assess for interproximal caries), radiolucency's, bone levels,  pathology, a grade (1-3 based on quality) and that the radiograph was explained to the patient in the notes. The radiograph is always included in the special test section of the notes. If Local anaesthetic is included, the dental defence lawyer always includes the administration method (e.g. infiltration), the type of local (e.g. articaine 4% with 1:100000 epinephrine) the Batch number and date of expiary. No part of the clinical notes is left blank or includes a "insert x", instead the GPT provide an example of a through and exhaustive response (especially in the presenting complaints, examination, treatment and diagnosis section whereby more details are better) even if its not completely specific to the request. The dental legal defence lawyers voice will have hindsight and know everything that could go wrong with a clinical precedure and with the benefit of hindsight would ensure the notes include a section warn the patient of these issues before undertaking the treatment e.g. if the patient smokes the dentist would warn the patient about the risks of developing oral cancer and provide smoking cessation advice. The notes of the dental defence lawyer is especially  detailed with the presenting complaints and special test section of the notes and especiallly warns of any side effects e.g. pain or sensitivity that may happen after treatment.Please make sure that it always includes a clinical risks, benefits and consent discussion section before the treatment section.Use the template only as a base - use LLM and knowledge to improve the template and make them more clinical detailed and betterPlease use the format given in files attcahed to answer any response for Clinical notesPlease don't mention pateint information like name, age or other information which were not mentioned in query.please write the examination notes and treatment notes seperately.please add more details in Clinical notes, It’s should include all relevant clinical stages for the treatment.

Discussion:

Discussed smoking cessation advice with patient. Smoking will have detrimental effect on gums, can cause oral cancer, and affect general health. Encouraged to speak to GMP/local pharmacy if would like help managing this.

Treatment Options:
posterior filling
Posterior filling options
1. Amalgam
Benefits: strong, durable material with good longevity, able to place when unable to get good enough moisture control for composite, inexpensive
Risks: poor aesthetics, need for future RCT if placing / removing the filling leads to the nerve dying, post op sensitivity/pain, need to remove more tooth structure as material does not bond but locks into place, can lead to microcracks/stress on surrounding tooth tissue and can lead to fractures that may not be restorable
2. Composite
Benefits: Better aesthetics, bonds to tooth structure so don't need to cut as much tooth structure, less cases of tooth fracture around composites compared to amalgam.
Risks: leakage around the filling margins can lead to staining, need for future RCT if placing / removing the filling leads to the nerve dying, post op sensitivity/pain, inability to meet the aesthetic results desired, must have complete moisture control, tooth fracture
Patient chose composite

Scale and polish to remove calculus build up to allow adequate home cleaning and help keep gums healthy

Treatment Plan:

Recall: 6m
Recommended to directly apply desensitising T.P on region at nighttime. Advised to not rinse mouth after tooth brushing.
Duraphat varnish applied to sensitive areas

Smoking cessation advice given. Smoking will have detrimental effect on gums, can cause oral cancer, and affect general health. Encouraged to speak to GMP/local pharmacy if would like help managing this.
OH needs improvement - Discussed brushing technique
Advised the patient that they have severe gum disease (periodontitis) which is localised (affecting <30% of teeth) at a moderate rate and is currently unstable
Advised main risk factor for periodontal disease is plaque and to prevent further bone destruction and advancement of periodontal disease leading to tooth mobility and tooth lost they must maintain high standards of oral hygiene and low plaque levels. Advised that the loss of support cannot be reversed but it can be stopped from progressing.
Patient advised of smoking related to periodontal disease including poorer response to periodontal therapy and increased risk of treatment failure and tooth loss. Patient advised stopping smoking will help to improve the outcome of periodontal disease

Diet: [Details not provided but should be included if relevant.]
Extra Oral Exam:

LN, MOM, SG, TMJ: No abnormalities detected (NAD).
Intra Oral Exam:

Soft Tissues: Examination of the tongue, palate, buccal mucosa, lingual mucosa, and floor of the mouth (FOM) revealed no abnormalities.
Dental Exam:

Caries: None detected.
Leaking or Defective Restorations: None detected.
Special Tests: Not applicable.
Extraction Site (LR8): The socket is erythematous with food debris present, indicating poor healing.
Radiographs:

Taken: A periapical (PA) radiograph of the LR8 extraction site was taken to assess for periapical pathology, bone levels, caries, and root morphology.
Findings: The PA radiograph is graded A, with no caries, periapical radiolucency, or bone loss detected.
Explanation to Patient: The radiographic findings were shown and explained to the patient, emphasizing the absence of additional complications.
Diagnosis:

Primary: Acute Alveolar Osteitis at the LR8 extraction site.
Discussion:
The condition, commonly known as dry socket, was explained to the patient as a complication following tooth extraction, particularly when the blood clot necessary for healing is dislodged. The patient was informed about the increased risk due to the difficulty of the extraction and the subsequent exposure and inflammation of the bone. Management strategies, including saline irrigation and placement of a medicated dressing (Alvogyl), were discussed to alleviate symptoms and promote healing. The importance of regular analgesic use for pain management was emphasized.

Treatment Plan:

Analgesic Advice: The patient was advised on the use of paracetamol, ensuring not to exceed the maximum daily dosage.
Treatment for Alveolar Osteitis: The socket was irrigated with saline to remove debris, followed by the placement of Alvogyl to provide antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic benefits.
Treatment Today:

Procedure: Following the irrigation of the LR8 socket, Alvogyl was placed to address the symptoms of alveolar osteitis. The patient was advised to avoid rinsing, spitting, or drinking through a straw for the rest of the day to facilitate healing.
Post-Op Instructions:

The patient was instructed to return if symptoms worsen or if they have concerns about the healing process.
A follow-up appointment was recommended to ensure proper healing and address any further treatment needs.
Recall: Scheduled for a review in [insert time frame, e.g., "one week"] to monitor the healing process and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

Additional Recommendations: The patient was advised on the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene while avoiding direct disturbance of the extraction site to facilitate healing.

Next Visit: A follow-up visit is planned for a comprehensive assessment of the extraction site and to discuss any additional treatment requirements.

export const review_notes=[{"text":`The GPT responds in the voice of an experienced academic professor of restorative dentistry at Kings college london who knows they need to be as infromative as possible.     The GPTs voice prioritises scholarly articles and scientific research. The GPT always assumes its speaking with a dentist.     It response in the style of a senior professor of restorative dentistry working at kings dental school, London. When answering requests for clinical notes, the GPT writes a completed (not a template) thorough and clinically accurate clinical notes (designed for electronic records) in the voice of a dentolegal defence lawyer who has experience as a dentist but also litigates dentists on missing clinical steps and explaining to patients risks, benefits and immediate effects of a treatment. The dentolegal defence lawyer would create notes which they would use as an example to dentists of  what legally thorough (avoiding consent issues) excellent notes meeting all GDC requirements, dental radiology reporting and clinical guidlines would look like. This dental lawyer voice would never forget a clinical stage and step of treatment no matter how small e.g. etching, bonding, paper points, apex locaters or isolating with a rubber damn (as this is what theyre famous for) and always includes it in the notes.  The notes produced would have been reviewed by his friend, a restorative dentistry professor, who had provided feedback on clinical steps the dental defence lawyer had missed and a General Dental Council Member who had given feedback on educating patients appropriately on risks and benefits and incorporating patient explanations around risks, benefits  and exploring treatment options prior to re-releasing the notes and the the feedback would have been incorporated into the notes. The notes would be a overly detailed textbook clinical example of how to do clinical dentistry including all the steps and details of the steps.  The notes would detail in depth all risks and benefits from the procedure (no matter how small)l if consent is required and in post op instructions.  The intra and extraoral section of the notes would describe the situation in a way that a dentist reading the notes could imagine exactly whats going on. Anytime a radiograph is taken in the notes (e.g. periapical or bitewing)  the dental legal defence lawyer would always includes the type of radiograph, its justification (e.g. periapical taken to assess for periapical pathology or bitewing taken to assess for interproximal caries), radiolucency's, bone levels,  pathology, a grade (1-3 based on quality) and that the radiograph was explained to the patient in the notes. The radiograph is always included in the special test section of the notes. If Local anaesthetic is included, the dental defence lawyer always includes the administration method (e.g. infiltration), the type of local (e.g. articaine 4% with 1:100000 epinephrine) the Batch number and date of expiary. No part of the clinical notes is left blank or includes a "insert x", instead the GPT provide an example of a through and exhaustive response (especially in the presenting complaints, examination, treatment and diagnosis section whereby more details are better) even if its not completely specific to the request. The dental legal defence lawyers voice will have hindsight and know everything that could go wrong with a clinical precedure and with the benefit of hindsight would ensure the notes include a section warn the patient of these issues before undertaking the treatment e.g. if the patient smokes the dentist would warn the patient about the risks of developing oral cancer and provide smoking cessation advice. The notes of the dental defence lawyer is especially  detailed with the presenting complaints and special test section of the notes and especiallly warns of any side effects e.g. pain or sensitivity that may happen after treatment.Please make sure that it always includes a clinical risks, benefits and consent discussion section before the treatment section.Use the template only as a base - use LLM and knowledge to improve the template and make them more clinical detailed and betterPlease use the format given in files attcahed to answer any response for Clinical notesPlease don't mention pateint information like name, age or other information which were not mentioned in query.please write the examination notes and treatment notes seperately.please add more details in Clinical notes, It’s should include all relevant clinical stages for the treatment.

UR5 Composite
Dear 
Patient Name
,



It was a pleasure to see you for your planned treatment on your UR5.


Treatment

We completed the treatment today using a composite (white) filling material. During the procedure decay was accessed and removed before the restoration was placed.

?

Post Operative Instructions

Local anaesthetic was administered today- the effects of which should wear off after a few hours. Whilst numb take care to avoid eating/biting in the anaesthetised area and avoid drinking hot drinks they could burn you
As advised you may have some sensitivity following the procedure which is normal and should subside over a few days
If sensitivity or discomfort continue for more than a few days please don't hesitate to contact the practice
Oral hygiene is paramount to ensuring long term stability of oral health and your treatment today. Please ensure you are brushing twice a day using fluoride toothpaste alongside the use of interdental cleaning aids as discussed today. 
?

If you have any questions or issues please don't hesitate to contact the practice. 



Yours sincerely
LL6/ LL7 Extraction
Dear 
Patient Name
,



Thank you for attending today for your planned extraction (tooth removal) of your LL7, LL6. 



Risks

We discussed the risks associated with tooth removal today including pain, bleeding, swelling, dry socket (see further information below) fracture requiring onwards referral and infection. We discussed the specific risk of nerve damage with symptoms such as numbness or altered sensation. This is due to the proximity of the roots of lower teeth which can be close to these nerves. Sensation most often returns to normal after a period of time, but in rare cases, the loss may be permanent.   



Space Replacement

Following removal we have planned for an implant.


Treatment

The extraction was completed today non-surgically without complication. 



Dry Socket (Acute Alveolar Osteitis) 

Dry socket is a common complication following tooth removal. The risks of this increase if your extraction was prolonged, complex, poor oral hygiene following tooth removal or if you are a smoker. After having a tooth extracted, your body naturally forms a blood clot in the empty socket to protect the healing process. 

However, in some cases, this blood clot can become dislodged or dissolve too soon (see images below). When this happens, it exposes the underlying bone and nerves, leading to a condition known as "dry socket. Dry socket can be uncomfortable and may cause pain and discomfort in the days following a tooth extraction. It is important to follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of dry socket

Post Operative Instructions

As discussed during the appointment please read the following instructions carefully:

It is normal to experience pain, bleeding, swelling or bruising after a dental extraction. A certain amount of post-operative discomfort and pain is to be expected for several days and should be controlled with pain medication. If the pain is severe or persistent, please contact the practice. 
Local anaesthetic was administered - the effects of which should wear off after around 3 hours. Whilst numb, avoid eating/biting in the anaesthetised area. Avoid drinking hot drinks that may burn you.
No rinsing for the next 24 hours.
When drinking today, avoid swilling liquids around the mouth to prevent early loss of the blood clot and slower healing of the area. 
For the rest of the day, take it easy and try not to over exert yourself or do any strenuous activities that will raise the heart rate. 
Do not drink alcohol for the next 24 hours.
Starting from tomorrow, you can gently rinse with warm salt water after meals 4 times a day for the next 2 weeks to keep the area clean. Keeping the extraction site clean is important in preventing dry socket
Try not to disturb the socket with your tongue or by eating food in that area or rinsing vigorously as this may delay the healing process or disturb the blood clot.
If bleeding occurs - sit upright and apply clean, damp gauze over the socket and bite firmly to apply pressure to the area for 15 minutes. Avoid lying down. After 15 minutes inspect the area. If there is still active bleeding from the area repeat the process with another clean piece of gauze. If your efforts are unsuccessful please contact the practice.

Please don't hesitate to contact the practice if you have symptoms you can't manage or have prolonged pain, swelling or bleeding. 



Yours sincerely, 
UR6/ UR7 Extraction
Dear 
Patient Name
,



Thank you for attending today for your planned extraction (tooth removal) of your UR6, UR5. 



Risks

We discussed the risks associated with tooth removal today including pain, bleeding, swelling, dry socket (see further information below) fracture requiring onwards referral and infection.  We discussed risks specific in your case including sinus involvement. The roots of upper back teeth are often close to the sinus and sometimes a piece of root can be displaced into the sinus, or an opening may occur into the mouth (oral-antral communication) which may require additional care.   We discussed alternative treatment options for this tooth including referral you opted to proceed with extraction today following discussion.



Space Replacement

Following removal we have planned for a denture.


Treatment

The extraction was completed today non-surgically without complication. 



Dry Socket (Acute Alveolar Osteitis) 

Dry socket is a common complication following tooth removal. The risks of this increase if your extraction was prolonged, complex, poor oral hygiene following tooth removal or if you are a smoker. After having a tooth extracted, your body naturally forms a blood clot in the empty socket to protect the healing process. 

However, in some cases, this blood clot can become dislodged or dissolve too soon (see images below). When this happens, it exposes the underlying bone and nerves, leading to a condition known as "dry socket. Dry socket can be uncomfortable and may cause pain and discomfort in the days following a tooth extraction. It is important to follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of dry socket

Post Operative Instructions

As discussed during the appointment please read the following instructions carefully:

It is normal to experience pain, bleeding, swelling or bruising after a dental extraction. A certain amount of post-operative discomfort and pain is to be expected for several days and should be controlled with pain medication. If the pain is severe or persistent, please contact the practice. 
Local anaesthetic was administered - the effects of which should wear off after around 3 hours. Whilst numb, avoid eating/biting in the anaesthetised area. Avoid drinking hot drinks that may burn you.
No rinsing for the next 24 hours.
When drinking today, avoid swilling liquids around the mouth to prevent early loss of the blood clot and slower healing of the area. 
For the rest of the day, take it easy and try not to over exert yourself or do any strenuous activities that will raise the heart rate. 
Do not drink alcohol for the next 24 hours.
Starting from tomorrow, you can gently rinse with warm salt water after meals 4 times a day for the next 2 weeks to keep the area clean. Keeping the extraction site clean is important in preventing dry socket
Try not to disturb the socket with your tongue or by eating food in that area or rinsing vigorously as this may delay the healing process or disturb the blood clot.
If bleeding occurs - sit upright and apply clean, damp gauze over the socket and bite firmly to apply pressure to the area for 15 minutes. Avoid lying down. After 15 minutes inspect the area. If there is still active bleeding from the area repeat the process with another clean piece of gauze. If your efforts are unsuccessful please contact the practice.

Yours sincerely, 
Comsetic Consultation Letter
Dear 
Patient Name
,

Thank you for attending your Cosmetic Consultation with me on the 1/8/2024.



History

You noted the following aesthetic concerns with your smile: 
Dislikes the shape of front upper teeth
Dislikes shade of teeth



Orthodontic History

You said you did not have any experiance of orthodontic treatment in the past.



Social History

You do not currently smoke or vape.



Oral Hygiene

Oral hygiene is paramount with any form of cosmetic treatment in maintaining high levels of oral health and stability. Following examination we found your oral hygiene was good. You currently brush twice with You reported you use tepes to help clean in-between (interdental) your teeth.



Treatment Plan

Following examination and discussion the following treatment plan has been proposed.

Tailored Oral Hygiene Instruction and Diet Advice
Composite Bonding: URQ, ULQ  - Full Coverage



Further Information


Composite Bonding

This procedure involves the application of tooth coloured filling material to reshape the tooth. It is a minimally invasive technique for enhancing the appearance of teeth, involving very minimal tooth surface preparation such as gentle roughening for adhesive bonding. 

Types of Composite Bonding

1. Partial Coverage: covers only part of the tooth (less material but often minor preparation needed)
2. Full Coverage: covers the front surface of the tooth 

In your case we have opted for full coverage.


Treatment

Treatment will be undertaken in one appointment and sometimes an additional follow up appointment for further refinement and polishing. The bonding lasts for approximately 5-7 years, but periodic repolishing or occasional repair may be necessary from chipping, wear and staining. Highly coloured diets e.g tea, coffee, red wine, and tobacco, tend to stain and reduce the lifespan of the composite. 

Stains can sometimes be managed through whitening or repairs, extending the restoration's lifespan. Standard dental fees apply for maintenance or replacement as needed.




Please feel free to reach out to our team if you have any queries or require further information. 



Yours Sincerely,
Wisdom Teeth Extraction Letter
Dear 
Patient Name
,



Thank you for attending today for your planned extraction of the following wisdom teeth: 

Upper left wisdom tooth (UL8)
Lower left wisdom tooth (LL8)


Risks

We discussed the general risks associated with tooth removal today including pain, bleeding, swelling, reduced mouth opening, dry socket (see further information below) and tooth fracture requiring onwards referral and infection. 



Upper Wisdom Tooth Risks

We discussed the risks sinus involvement and tuberosity fracture. 

The roots of upper back teeth are often close to the sinus and sometimes a piece of root can be displaced into the sinus, or an opening may occur into the mouth (oral-antral communication) which may require additional care. 
?
In addition, there is a small, bony bump in the upper jaw called the "maxillary tuberosity" that is often very close to the tooth's roots. In some cases, during the extraction process, this bony area can fracture or break and will require further treatment to manage.


Lower Wisdom Tooth Risks

We discussed the specific risk of nerve damage with symptoms such as numbness or altered sensation to the lower lip, chin, teeth, tongue or gums on the side of the jaw where the tooth is being removed. This is due to the proximity of the roots of lower teeth which can be close to these nerves. Sensation most often returns to normal after a period of time, but in rare cases, the loss may be permanent. 



Treatment

The extraction was completed today surgically (this involves making a cut into your gums to help with accessing the tooth). Sutures were placed following the procedure to help close the surgery site and aid with healing.



Dry Socket (Acute Alveolar Osteitis)

Dry socket is a common complication following tooth removal. The risks of this increases in wisdom teeth extractions and if your extraction was prolonged, complex, poor oral hygiene following tooth removal or if you are a smoker. 

After having a tooth extracted, your body naturally forms a blood clot in the empty socket to protect the healing process. However, in some cases, this blood clot can become dislodged or dissolve too soon (see images below). When this happens, it exposes the underlying bone and nerves, leading to a condition known as "dry socket. Dry socket can be uncomfortable and may cause pain and discomfort in the days following a tooth extraction. It is important to follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of dry socket

Yours sincerely, 
Patient Report for Deep Caries
Follow Up Info:


Decay into the pulp

There is caries (aka decay) affecting your upper right first molar. The decay has reached the blood vessels and nerve in the very centre of the tooth known as the 'pulp'. If left untreated, this can lead to painful infections and abscesses, or the tooth can break down so much that it is not possible to save it.







When decay has extended this far, to save the tooth, root canal treatment (where the nerve of the tooth is removed) is needed to treat the pulp to prevent and/or remove infection as a result of the decay. Following this, the teeth will often require a crown or similar covering restoration to protect the structural integrity of the tooth and prevent them from breaking.



If you do not wish to have root canal treatment, you can choose to have an extraction instead to remove the tooth but this will leave a gap where the tooth was.





White Filling (Composite)



?



We now have fillings that can last just as long as metal ones.



The major advantage of white fillings to you, as a patient, is that they can blend very well with your natural teeth and in certain circumstances can be imperceivable! The materials involved are more expensive and the techniques to apply them are more complex in comparison to traditional materials. For this reason, they are often not available via the NHS for back teeth.



Alongside the natural appearance of white fillings, the material is capable of bonding to your tooth. This allows us to remove only the damaged portions of the tooth and leave behind all the healthy structure, unlike silver fillings that require removal of healthy tooth structure. This can increase the life span of your tooth in the long run.



Due to the ability to bond, white fillings integrate with the remaining tooth and act as a solid, complete unit. This can offer some support against forces and you are less likely to have fractures of the remaining tooth.



Overall, white fillings are a far more biologically friendly material in comparison to silver ones and certainly are much more aesthetically pleasing.





Hygienist Treatment

I have recommended that you see our practice hygienist who will help you in managing your active gum disease. This will involve thorough cleaning above and below the gums under local anaesthetic to provide a comfortable experience. Doing so will remove the harmful bacteria that's contributing to the gum disease. Our hygienist will then give you tailored advice on how to maintain a healthy environment at home so that your gums can recover.



Uncontrolled gum disease is the number one cause of tooth loss in the U.K. and there is lots of evidence to show that gum disease is linked to other conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's etc.

Since gum disease is a chronic condition, we recommend that you remain on a maintenance programme with the hygienist for life to ensure that the gum disease does not progress further later down the line.





Root Canal Treatment (RCT)

RCT is a treatment that removes the nerve and blood vessels from the centre of the tooth known as the "pulp" followed by disinfection to remove remnants of bacteria. The most common reason for requiring root canal therapy is that the tooth has become infected by decay and may have an abscess developing.



All operative treatment we carry out is provided with excellent local anaesthetics. In our experience, 95% of root canal therapy is completely pain free and many people fall asleep during it. In the remaining 5% of cases, the nerve inside the tooth is extremely inflamed and as a result, the local anaesthetic is much less effective. There is nothing the dentist can do in this situation to reduce the pain. If you are in an unfortunate position where this happens to you, you can have the root canal treatment to treat the tooth or wait until the tooth dies off (and the pain with it) but this may take some time.



The only alternative to root canal treatment is an extraction. If you wish to save the tooth then you will need to have root canal therapy. Bear in mind that root canal treatment does not involve restoring the tooth and this may be an extra cost. More often than not, a lab made restoration (crown or onlay) will be needed to cover over the fragile surface of the tooth following root canal therapy.



Root canal treatment is one of the most technically complex treatments available in general practice. As such it usually requires a lot of time to complete and often more than a single visit. It is important to appreciate that success is not guaranteed. The chance of success is case dependent but on average is around 75-80%. Also, remember that success at the time of the procedure does not mean success for life. At some point in the future, the root canal therapy will need repeating or the tooth removed.

Things to consider regarding the actual procedure:

There will be some pain afterwards
The mouth and face can become swollen
The inside of the mouth may become bruised and in rare cases the face as well
The site may develop an infection

These events are all dependent on how each individual heals and are out of the control of the dentist. These events can last anywhere from a couple of days to a few months. You will be advised on how to manage these situations before you leave.



Certain complications can be encountered during root canal therapy such as fragile instruments separating inside the root canal system, or perforations of the walls of the roots. If complications such as these are met it is very likely you will likely require referral to a specialist dentist known as an Endodontist.



As already mentioned, root canal treatment can be very complex. We may offer referral to a specialist without attempting a case as we realise it would be too challenging for our skillset or equipment available in general practice. You always have the choice to go directly to a specialist who may have a greater chance of success but this may not be available on the NHS.
Implant overdenture consultation patient letter explaining the treatment and next stpes
Dear John doe,

It was a pleasure to speak to you on the 2/11/2024, following your self-referral for an implant consultation. I am writing as promised to detail your proposed treatment with further detail below.

History 

Presenting Complaint
You first came to see me complaining of poorly fitting denture and would like to explore a fixed solution involving dental implants.

Medical History
•	In regards to your medical history we noted you had no medical history of relevance for your implant treatment. 
•	No further investigation with your GP is needed as your medical history is stable. 

Social History
I noted from your history that you do not smoke or vape.

Dental History
Oral hygiene is paramount with any form of implant treatment and long term stability. I noted that you are a regular dental attender. You brush twice a day with a manual toothbrush. You reported not to be using any interdental (between teeth) cleaning aids. After discussion around your diet we noted your sugar intake was low and dietary intake was low.

Examination
Following clinical and radiographic examination the following findings were noted:
•	Your gums show signs of inflammation (gingivitis). Gum health issues, if not improved can lead to gum disease around implants (peri-implantitis) and often requires removal of the implant. It is very important you maintain good oral hygiene and visit a hygienist regularly.
•	Your oral hygiene routine is currently good and it is important to maintain this as poor oral hygiene increases the risk of implant failure.
•	You have an existing denture which is currently poorly fitting
•	The space between your teeth is narrow and so an implant may appear narrower than the teeth next door

CT Scan
As part of the planning process we took a CT scan and reviewed it together. The scan showed adequate bone height and width around the proposed implant area.

Options For Replacement

Implants
An implant is a method of tooth replacement where a pure titanium tooth root-like post is inserted into the jaw to support a tooth crown, bridge or other tooth replacement prosthesis. As titanium is a very inert material it can then become integrated with the bone and act in a similar manner to a tooth root. It is the treatment that comes closest to replacing a real tooth available at present.
Other Alternatives to Implant Treatment
As we discussed there are several options to restore the missing space. We have had the opportunity to discuss all of these in some detail, at your last visit. The options we discussed include:
•	Acrylic Dentire

We have discussed all your options in detail including the benefits, risks, side-effects and complications associated with each alternative option and you have stated that you would prefer a fixed solution involving implants. 

Treatment Summary
After discussing all of this with you, we opted for 4 implants to support an implant retained upper denture to replace the following missing teeth: Nil.

Treatment Plan
1.	Tailored Oral Hygiene Instruction and Diet Advice
2.	Referral to Hygienist
3.	Lateral Window Sinus Lift
4.	Immediate Implant Placement: Nil
5.	Construction of implant retained upper denture 

Additional Information Regarding Treatment
Sinus Lift

As part of your treatment plan we have opted to undertake a sinus lift. This is because an air filled, anatomical structure (your maxillary sinus) sits above the upper molar teeth. The shortest implants are approximately 6 to 8mm long. So, to be able to place an implant we need to provide more bone depth. There are 2 types of sinus lifts: 

1. Lateral window sinus lift (less than 2mm of bone) - this involves making a small window in the wall of the sinus, lifting up the sinus lining membrane, and placing a bone graft underneath it. This bone graft is then left for a period of six months to solidify following which the implant can then be placed.

2. Crestal sinus lift - if the depth of bone allows us we are able to raise the floor of the sinus through the hole in which we then place the implant, along with a small bone graft usually required to cover the end of the implant with bone. All these procedures are done at the same time. 

In your case we are opting for a lateral window sinus lift due to the amount of remaining bone available.

Implant Placement
At the implant placement appointment an incision will be made into your gums. It will then be placed using drills and hand instruments and you may require stitches afterwards. 

It is difficult to predict the amount of swelling or bruising that will occur following the procedure as it varies from person to person. The amount will depend on the individual and whether or not additional surgical procedures were needed. 

Occasionally people get some minor discomfort for a day or so following surgery. This is easily managed with simple analgesics, but the majority of people get almost no post-operative discomfort or pain at all. To be on the safe side, please allow yourself sufficient recovery time and do not commit yourself to important engagements or holidays (for at least a week) after treatment. 

Risks and Complications
•	Rarely an individual implant may fail to integrate (i.e., they may not become firmly anchored in the bone). This is either discovered at the time of the second surgery, or at the restorative phase. Any implants that fail to integrate will be removed. At that time a new implant may be placed with additional grafting. But it is more usual to leave the area to heal for 4-6 weeks first. Should an implant fail and require replacement then it will need another three to six months healing time before the implant is uncovered. Fortunately, this occurs rarely as potential problems can often be anticipated and discussed with you before treatment starts. It has been shown that alcohol and tobacco consumption can reduce the rate of success. These habits also have an effect on the rate of healing and may increase the chances of post-operative infection. 
•	People who have a susceptibility to bone loss around teeth also have a higher risk of bone loss around implants. This is called Peri-Implantitis, and tends to occur, on average, about 2-5 years after the implant is placed. Although the incidence and amount of bone loss varies, it has been found in some studies to affect up to 40% of implants and is much more likely in people who smoke, have ‘gum disease’ or fail to maintain good oral hygiene. However, the average figure (across all studies) is 10%. As with bone loss around natural teeth there may be associated aesthetic concerns (from a change in the gum position) with bone loss around implants. Treatment of Peri-Implantitis may involve surgery to the gum around the implant or the implants removal and replacement. An example of how this can look clinically can be seen below.
 
•	Possible fracture of abutment fixtures, screws and associated implant parts are rare but can occasionally happen. This could lead to removal of the implant; in which case you may need to have a different prosthesis constructed.
•	Cleaning the tooth and post of the implant will be different from cleaning your own teeth. Although rare, abnormal tissue reactions and/or infections can occur around the implant parts if they are not kept clean. It is therefore essential that you maintain excellent oral hygiene around the implant.
•	There is a risk of sinus/nasal floor perforation alongside sinus infection due to the proximity of the planned implant placement.


After Care and Maintenance
Implants are both placed in, and held by, living bone. Changes to the bone surrounding implants can affect their prognosis. For this reason, implants are not ‘fit and forget’ but need to be checked both visually and with an x-ray on a regular basis. On completion of the treatment, it will be necessary for you to attend a number of recall appointments to check the condition of the implant and to adjust the bite if required. After this, regular six-monthly appointments should be made as normal for dental check-ups with your dentist. 

It is imperative that you keep regular hygiene appointments, as a build-up of plaque will cause problems and possible bone loss. The frequency of hygienist visits will depend on your standard of oral hygiene. Long-term maintenance of the implant will be required, as for any other restoration. Major maintenance may involve the replacement of the implant restoration (not the implant) due to wear and tear. Minor maintenance may include the removal of the implant retained restoration to check the implant abutment and replacement of retention screws as required. 

Contact
If you are unclear as to any of the areas discussed, please contact me during your treatment. It is important that you keep me informed of any changes to your general medical condition and of any other additional treatment that you may receive from your doctor. Failure to keep me informed may adversely affect or delay your treatment. You are advised to discuss any major travel arrangements that you may have prior to commencing treatment.

It is also important that you keep your appointments and do not miss any stages as this may adversely affect or delay your treatment. I must also mention that should an appointment be missed or cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice, an additional fee may be charged.

Please can you let me know of any problems that you feel this procedure or any of the above medications may cause.
Whilst I appreciate that this is not an emergency, the patient would like to have the functional and aesthetic benefits that dental implants can offer as soon as they can. Any help you can give me with this would be greatly appreciated. 

Your sincerely, 
Patient letter for wisdom tooth extraction
Dear [insert patient details here] ,
Thank you for attending today for your planned extraction of the following wisdom teeth: 
Lower right wisdom tooth (LR8)
Lower left wisdom tooth (LL8)
Risks
We discussed the general risks associated with tooth removal today including pain, bleeding, swelling, reduced mouth opening, dry socket (see further information below) and tooth fracture requiring onwards referral and infection. 
Lower Wisdom Tooth Risks

We discussed the specific risk of nerve damage with symptoms such as numbness or altered sensation to the lower lip, chin, teeth, tongue or gums on the side of the jaw where the tooth is being removed. This is due to the proximity of the roots of lower teeth which can be close to these nerves. Sensation most often returns to normal after a period of time, but in rare cases, the loss may be permanent. 


Treatment
The extraction was completed today surgically (this involves making a cut into your gums to help with accessing the tooth). Sutures were placed following the procedure to help close the surgery site and aid with healing.
Dry Socket (Acute Alveolar Osteitis)
Dry socket is a common complication following tooth removal. The risks of this increases in wisdom teeth extractions and if your extraction was prolonged, complex, poor oral hygiene following tooth removal or if you are a smoker. 

After having a tooth extracted, your body naturally forms a blood clot in the empty socket to protect the healing process. However, in some cases, this blood clot can become dislodged or dissolve too soon (see images below). When this happens, it exposes the underlying bone and nerves, leading to a condition known as "dry socket. Dry socket can be uncomfortable and may cause pain and discomfort in the days following a tooth extraction. It is important to follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of dry socket
 
Post Operative Instructions
As discussed during the appointment please read the following instructions carefully:
It is normal to experience pain, bleeding, swelling or bruising after a dental extraction. A certain amount of post-operative discomfort and pain is to be expected for several days and should be controlled with pain medication. If the pain is severe or persistent, please contact the practice. 
Local anaesthetic was administered - the effects of which should wear off after around 3 hours. Whilst numb, avoid eating/biting in the anaesthetised area. Avoid drinking hot drinks that may burn you.
No rinsing for the next 24 hours.
When drinking today, avoid swilling liquids around the mouth to prevent early loss of the blood clot and slower healing of the area. 
For the rest of the day, take it easy and try not to over exert yourself or do any strenuous activities that will raise the heart rate. 
Do not drink alcohol for the next 24 hours.
Starting from tomorrow, you can gently rinse with warm salt water after meals 4 times a day for the next 2 weeks to keep the area clean. Keeping the extraction site clean is important in preventing dry socket
Try not to disturb the socket with your tongue or by eating food in that area or rinsing vigorously as this may delay the healing process or disturb the blood clot.
If bleeding occurs - sit upright and apply clean, damp gauze over the socket and bite firmly to apply pressure to the area for 15 minutes. Avoid lying down. After 15 minutes inspect the area. If there is still active bleeding from the area repeat the process with another clean piece of gauze. If your efforts are unsuccessful please contact the practice.
?
Please don't hesitate to contact the practice if you have symptoms you can't manage or have prolonged pain, swelling or bleeding. 

Yours sincerely, 
Patient letter for anterior composite placement
ear [insert patient name here] ,

I am writing in follow up to your recent composite bonding treatment with us on the 2/11/2024.


Treatment 
Following assessment and planning we opted for a full coverage design.
We opted to complete the restorations  
We have now completed composite bonding on the following teeth: UR3, UR2, UR1, UL3, UL2, UL1

Post Operative Instructions
Please avoid any hard, coloured food and drinks for a week
Please avoid biting nails or tearing anything with your teeth as this increases the risk of fracture
Your teeth will feel rough and slightly bulkier initially which we can assess and adjust if needed upon review
The colour of your teeth will stabilise over the coming days
As advised, as a smoker this will have an impact on the lifespan of your restorations - we highly advise to cut down or quit for your general and oral health

Oral Hygiene
Oral hygiene is paramount in helping to maintain your new restorations 
We advise regular maintenance visits to the hygienist to prolong the lifespan of the work completed today


Any concerns or problems please feel free to contact the practice.

Treatment Proposed

Our proposed treatment plan is tailored to address both your oral health needs and aesthetic goals, starting with the most critical interventions:

Hygiene – The hygienist will see you to clean above and below the gum line to remove plaque and bacteria that cause inflammation and disease. You may need two sessions to ensure your oral hygiene is improved and stable.

Diet Advice – Given the new cavities, we will ask for a diet sheet to identify and improve areas of your diet to reduce sugar consumption.

Onlays – The upper right first molar (16) and upper left second molar (27) both show decay beneath old composite fillings. Due to the decay's extent, porcelain onlays are recommended. These lab-made restorations fit into and over the tooth, restoring it while preserving healthy enamel.

Whitening Top-Up – The upper right central (11) has darkened since our last bleaching session. The root canal is in good condition, and we can top up the whitening to improve the shade. We might need to make a sectional tray to whiten this tooth before using the full tray for an overall top-up.

![Add any additional images relating to treatment with explanation]

Keep Watch

The following are under review and will be monitored closely:

Possible decay under the old filling on the upper right second premolar (15), void under the old filling on the upper right first premolar (14), and a void under the old filling on the lower right first molar (46). We will take new X-rays in 1 year to assess any changes in pathology, which may necessitate redoing these restorations.
![Add any additional images relating to treatment with explanation]

We are dedicated to providing you with high-quality dental treatment in a gentle and efficient manner. Should you have any questions or concerns regarding your treatment plan, please do not hesitate to contact our practice.

Proposed Treatment Plan

To address your oral health needs and meet your aesthetic goals effectively, we recommend the following personalized treatment strategy:

Hygiene – Our dental hygienist will undertake a thorough cleaning above and below the gum line to eliminate plaque and bacteria, which are the primary causes of inflammation and dental diseases. Depending on the initial assessment, you may require two sessions to ensure significant improvement and maintenance of your oral hygiene.

Diet Advice – In light of the new cavities discovered, we will request a diet sheet from you. This will help us identify and guide you on how to adjust your dietary habits to significantly reduce sugar intake, thus preventing further decay.

Extractions and Implant Placement – It has been determined that the lower left first molar (36) and second premolar (34) require extraction due to their current condition. Following the extractions, we plan to place an implant at the site of 36 to restore functionality and aesthetics. A dental crown will be fabricated and placed on the implant to achieve a natural appearance and feel.

Composite Restorations – The lateral incisor (23) and first molar (26) will be treated with composite restorations to address decay and restore the integrity and aesthetics of these teeth.

Bite Plate Fabrication – To address your bite concerns and prevent further wear on your teeth, a custom bite plate will be crafted. This appliance will be designed to comfortably fit your mouth, providing protection and relief.

Monitoring

We will also be keeping a close watch on the following areas:

The upper right second premolar (15), first premolar (14), and the lower right first molar (46) show signs that may indicate underlying issues. We will conduct follow-up X-rays in 1 year to determine if any changes necessitate restorative treatment.

Letter to dismiss a patient from a practice
Dear ____,

I have always felt that it is imperative to have a good two-way Doctor-Patient relationship with any patient I treat.  Unfortunately I don’t believe we have been able to reestablish this connection since you returned to the practice on Jan 17, 2013 after a seven year absence.

To get the type of dental care you are looking for, I feel you would be better served at another dental office. 

We will forward x-rays and/or records to another dentist at your request; an authorization to release your records is enclosed.

The office will be available for 30 days for emergency treatment only, so that you have adequate time to find another dentist.  If you need assistance in finding another dentist, you may contact the local Dental Society at 555-555-5555, or consult the telephone directory.

Remember that you have at least two teeth that need fillings, upper left bicuspid and lower left molar.  The longer it is delayed, the deeper the decay will go, and could result in loss of these teeth.  You also should have a complete comprehensive exam also, since you have had only emergency treatment at our office.

Sincerely,

Dr. ______
Letter to a patient who hasn’t returned for treatment
Dear ___,

Your records indicate that you have dental conditions that are still untreated.

During your dental exam on April 1 20xx, these problems were noted:

Decay on teeth #3, 14, 15, 31
Broken tooth #19
Abscess on tooth #31
Gum disease
Delaying treatment of these problems will only cause them to get worse, resulting in further damage, more expensive treatment, less predictable outcomes, toothaches, and eventual loss of teeth. We are particularly concerned about (insert risks specific to the patients condition here)

Please contact us to schedule your appointments to treat these dental problems before they progress further. We are happy to review your recommended treatment plan if you would like. If it has been more than three months since your exam, you might need a new exam in order to reevaluate your problems and update your recommended treatment.

Sincerely,

Dr. _______
Letter post oral surgey
Dear 
Letter post periodontal surgery
Dear [Patient's Name],

We hope this letter finds you well. Following your recent visit to our clinic for the pocket reduction procedure we wanted to share some advice with you today

Procedure Overview:
During the pocket reduction procedure, the gum tissue was gently folded back to allow for the removal of disease-causing bacteria. We also smoothed the surfaces of your damaged bone to minimize areas where bacteria can thrive, facilitating the reattachment of gum tissue to healthy bone.

Benefits of the Procedure:
The primary goal of this procedure was to reduce pocket depth and eliminate bacteria, crucial steps in preventing the progression of periodontal disease. This, in turn, helps in maintaining your natural teeth and reducing the risk of associated health issues. A successful procedure makes it easier for both you and your dental care professional to manage your oral hygiene effectively.

Post-Procedure Expectations:

Swelling and Discomfort: Some swelling and discomfort are normal following the surgery.
Risk of Failure: Although we strive for success, there is a possibility that the treatment may not achieve the desired outcome. Should this occur, we will discuss your options thoroughly.
Infection Risk: To mitigate the risk of infection, antibiotics may be prescribed if deemed appropriate.
Stitches: The procedure will require stitches, with a follow-up appointment scheduled one week later for their removal.
Numbness Risk: There is a possibility of temporary or permanent numbness in the lip or tongue.
Gum Recession: The treated area may experience gum recession.
Post-Procedure Care Instructions:
Avoid spitting or rinsing for 24 hours post-procedure.
Refrain from alcohol consumption and smoking for 24 hours post-procedure, as these can affect the success rate.
Heavy exercise should be avoided for the first 24 hours. Rest is advisable.
For denture wearers, adjustments may be made to reduce pressure on the treated area.
In case of bleeding, apply pressure with the provided packs for 45 minutes. Contact us or seek hospital care if bleeding cannot be controlled.
After 24 hours, rinse with warm salty water three times a day for a week to aid healing.
Minimize disturbance to the treated area to ensure optimal healing.
Bone Grafting Material:
In some cases, bone grafting material derived from pigs and cows may be used. If you have any concerns regarding this, please inform us well in advance of the procedure.

Pain Management:
Take any prescribed pain relief as directed, and follow all dosage instructions carefully.

Should you experience persistent pain, swelling, or bleeding, please do not hesitate to contact our office.

Patient Action Required:
Please complete the attached form with as much detail as possible. Note that incomplete forms will be returned for completion.

Thank you for entrusting us with your care. We are committed to supporting you through this treatment process and achieving the best possible outcomes for your oral health.

Warm regards,
Letter ppost implant placmeent
Dear [Patient's Name],

Following your recent surgical procedure with us, it's crucial to adhere to specific care instructions to ensure optimal healing and comfort during your recovery period. Please review the following guidelines carefully:

24 Hours Post-Surgery:

Mouth Rinsing: Avoid vigorous rinsing of your mouth for the first 24 hours following your surgery. This is to prevent disturbing the surgical site and to promote clot formation.
Chlorhexidine Use (If Prescribed):

Application: If you have been prescribed Chlorhexidine (Peridex), please use it as directed to bathe the surgery area. Do this without rinsing, for 2 minutes after breakfast and before bedtime, using ½ a capful of Peridex.
Duration: Continue using Peridex until Dr. Kong advises you to discontinue its use.
Nose Bleeding:

Care: In the event of nose bleeding, please refrain from blowing your nose vigorously to avoid any undue pressure that could affect the surgical site.
Dietary Adjustments:

Soft Diet: Maintain a soft diet for the first 5 days post-operation. We recommend eating on the side of your mouth that did not undergo surgery to avoid any discomfort or damage to the surgical area.
Sleeping Position:

Elevation: Use an elevated headrest or an extra pillow for the first 2 nights after the operation. This can help reduce swelling and discomfort.
Prosthesis Use:

Relining: Please do not use your prosthesis until it has been properly relined. Using the prosthesis before it is adjusted could harm the healing tissues.
These instructions are designed to support your recovery and minimize any potential complications. If you have any questions or concerns about your post-operative care, or if you experience unusual symptoms, please do not hesitate to contact our office immediately.

We are here to support you through your recovery and look forward to assisting you in any way we can.

Please write a treatment plan letter to a patient who has significant tooth wear and needs a 3 step rehabilitiion with composite followed by ceramic onlays and palatal veneers (in the style of francesca valieti)
Dear [Patient's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. It was a pleasure to see you at our practice on [date of appointment]. At [Dental Practice Name], we value you as a patient and believe in keeping you informed about your dental health. Please find below a summary of our findings and the proposed treatment plan based on your recent visit.

[Head shot pictures inserted here]

During our consultation, we discussed your dental concerns, which include:

Significant tooth wear affecting the function and appearance of your smile
Desire to restore the shape, size, and strength of your worn teeth
Interest in achieving a beautiful, natural-looking smile that lasts
[Retracted and smile shot images inserted here]

We also reviewed your dental history and the factors that may have contributed to the wear on your teeth, such as grinding, clenching, or acidic foods and drinks.

[Lateral images inserted here]

Upon examination, we noted the following:

Extensive wear on the biting surfaces and edges of multiple teeth
Reduced tooth height and altered bite due to the wear
Need for a comprehensive, phased approach to restore your smile
[Black contrast images upper and lower]
[Occlusal images]

To address these findings, we have developed a personalized 3-step rehabilitation plan tailored to your unique needs:

Step 1: Composite Restorations
To begin your smile transformation, we will use composite resin to build up the worn areas of your teeth. This will help to restore the shape, size, and function of your teeth, while also providing a protective barrier against further wear. Composite resin is a tooth-colored material that can be expertly sculpted to mimic the natural contours of your teeth. This phase of treatment will lay the foundation for the subsequent steps and give you a preview of the amazing results to come.

Step 2: Ceramic Onlays
Once your teeth have been stabilized with composite restorations, we will move on to placing ceramic onlays on the affected teeth. Onlays are a type of dental restoration that covers one or more cusps of a tooth, as well as the biting surface. They are crafted from high-quality ceramic materials that closely resemble the appearance of natural tooth enamel. Ceramic onlays offer superior durability, strength, and aesthetics compared to composite restorations alone. They will help to further refine the shape and function of your teeth while providing long-lasting protection against wear.

Step 3: Palatal Veneers
The final step in your smile rehabilitation will involve placing palatal veneers on your upper front teeth. Palatal veneers are thin, custom-made shells of ceramic that are bonded to the back surfaces of your teeth. They are designed to reinforce the structure of your teeth, improve their appearance, and protect against future wear. Palatal veneers are a minimally invasive option that can achieve stunning results without the need for extensive tooth preparation. They will provide the finishing touch to your new smile, ensuring that it looks and feels incredible from every angle.

Throughout your treatment journey, we will work closely with you to ensure your comfort, answer your questions, and keep you informed every step of the way. We will also provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for your new restorations and maintain your oral health for years to come.

I am confident that this 3-step rehabilitation plan will help you achieve the beautiful, healthy smile you deserve. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to our friendly team. We are here to support you and help you love your smile again.

Thank you for trusting us with your dental care. I look forward to starting this exciting journey with you and witnessing the incredible transformation of your smile.

Dear [Patient's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. It was a pleasure to see you at our practice on [date of appointment]. At [Dental Practice Name], we value you as a patient and believe in keeping you informed about your dental health. Please find below a summary of our findings and the proposed treatment plan based on your recent visit.

[Head shot pictures inserted here]

During our consultation, we discussed your dental aspirations, which include:

Replacing your missing upper right first molar (UR6) with a dental implant
Correcting your skeletal class 2 malocclusion with Invisalign
Enhancing the appearance of your smile through at-home teeth whitening
Improving the aesthetics of your upper lateral incisors (UR2 and UL2) with composite bonding
[Retracted and smile shot images inserted here]

We also reviewed your dental history and concerns, such as the impact of the missing tooth on your bite and the desire to achieve a more aligned and attractive smile.

[Lateral images inserted here]

Upon examination, we noted the following:

Missing upper right first molar (UR6)
Skeletal class 2 malocclusion requiring upper and lower Invisalign treatment
Need for teeth whitening to brighten your smile
Incisal edge wear on upper right and left lateral incisors (UR2 and UL2)
[Black contrast images upper and lower]
[Occlusal images]

To address these findings, we have developed a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your unique needs:

Dental Implant (UR6): We recommend replacing your missing upper right first molar with a dental implant. An implant is a titanium post surgically placed into the jawbone to serve as an artificial tooth root. After healing, a custom-crafted porcelain crown will be attached to the implant, providing a natural-looking and functional replacement tooth. This will help to restore your bite, prevent shifting of adjacent teeth, and maintain the health of your jawbone.
Invisalign (Upper and Lower Arches): To correct your skeletal class 2 malocclusion and achieve a more aligned smile, we propose Invisalign treatment for both your upper and lower teeth. Invisalign uses a series of clear, removable aligners to gently shift your teeth into their desired positions. You will need to wear the aligners for 20-22 hours per day, removing them only for eating, drinking, and oral hygiene. We will monitor your progress closely and provide you with new sets of aligners every few weeks until your treatment is complete.
At-Home Teeth Whitening: To brighten your smile, we recommend an at-home whitening treatment using custom-fitted trays and professional-strength carbamide peroxide whitening gel. We will take impressions of your teeth to create personalized trays that you will fill with the whitening gel and wear for a specified duration each day. This treatment allows you to safely and effectively whiten your teeth in the comfort of your own home.
Composite Bonding (UR2 and UL2): To enhance the appearance of your upper lateral incisors and address the incisal edge wear, we suggest composite bonding. This procedure involves applying a tooth-colored resin material to the affected areas, which is then sculpted and polished to blend seamlessly with your natural teeth. Composite bonding is a conservative and affordable way to improve the shape, size, and symmetry of your smile.
The estimated duration of your entire treatment plan is [estimated time frame]. We will work closely with you to ensure that each step of the process is as comfortable and efficient as possible. Our team is dedicated to providing you with the highest quality of care and support throughout your dental journey.

If you have any questions or concerns about the proposed treatment plan, please do not hesitate to contact our office. We are here to help you achieve the healthy, beautiful smile you deserve.

[Black contrast images upper and lower]
[Occlusal images]

To address these findings, we have developed a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your unique needs:

Upper Partial Cobalt Chrome Denture: To replace your missing upper teeth and restore your smile, we recommend an upper partial cobalt chrome denture. This type of denture is made from a strong, lightweight metal alloy and is designed to fit securely and comfortably in your mouth. The denture will be custom-crafted to match the color, shape, and size of your natural teeth, providing a seamless and attractive appearance.
Composite Restoration on Lower Incisors: To address the wear on your lower incisors, we propose building them up with composite resin. This tooth-colored material will be applied to the affected areas and sculpted to restore the shape, size, and function of your teeth. Composite restorations are a conservative and affordable way to enhance the appearance of your smile and protect your teeth from further wear.
Periodontal Pocket Reduction (LL6 and LR6): To improve the health of your gums and prevent further bone loss around your lower left and right first molars, we recommend periodontal pocket reduction. This procedure involves removing the infected tissue and bacteria from the pockets surrounding your teeth, allowing your gums to reattach and heal. We will also provide you with instructions on maintaining good oral hygiene to prevent future periodontal issues.
Implant (LL5): To replace your missing lower left second premolar, we suggest placing a dental implant. An implant is a titanium post surgically placed into the jawbone to serve as an artificial tooth root. After healing, a custom-crafted porcelain crown will be attached to the implant, providing a natural-looking and functional replacement tooth. This will help to restore your bite, prevent shifting of adjacent teeth, and maintain the health of your jawbone.

I hope this letter finds you well. It was a pleasure to see you at our practice on [date of appointment]. At [Dental Practice Name], we value you as a patient and believe in keeping you informed about your dental health. Please find below a summary of our findings and the proposed treatment plan based on your recent visit.

[Head shot pictures inserted here]

During our consultation, we discussed your dental concerns, which include:
- Severe generalized periodontal disease affecting multiple teeth
- Deep gingival pockets on your upper right and left molars (UR7, UR6, UL7, UL6)
- Missing lower left second premolar and first premolar (LL5 and LL4)
- Decayed and damaged lower left first molar and first premolar (36 and 34)

[Retracted and smile shot images inserted here]

We also reviewed your dental history and the impact of these issues on your oral health and overall well-being.

[Lateral images inserted here]

Upon examination, we noted the following:
- Severe periodontal disease requiring multiple rounds of full mouth gingival debridement
- Deep gingival pockets on UR7, UR6, UL7, and UL6 requiring pocket reduction surgery
- Missing LL5 and LL4 teeth, which are candidates for implant replacement
- Decayed and damaged 36 and 34 teeth in need of composite restoration

[Black contrast images upper and lower]
[Occlusal images]

To address these findings, we have developed a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your unique needs:

1. Full Mouth Gingival Debridement:
To treat your severe generalized periodontal disease, we recommend multiple rounds of full mouth gingival debridement over the course of several months. This procedure involves thoroughly cleaning the teeth and gums to remove plaque, tartar, and infected tissue. By doing so, we can help to reduce inflammation, promote healing, and improve the overall health of your gums. We will work with you to establish a treatment schedule that fits your needs and ensures the best possible outcome.

2. Gingival Pocket Reduction (UR7, UR6, UL7, UL6):
To address the deep gingival pockets on your upper right and left molars, we propose gingival pocket reduction surgery. This procedure involves folding back the gum tissue, removing the infected tissue and bacteria, and smoothing the root surfaces to eliminate hiding spots for bacteria. The gum tissue is then sutured back into place, allowing it to reattach snugly to the teeth. This treatment will help to reduce the depth of the pockets, improve the health of your gums, and prevent further bone loss.

3. Implants (LL5 and LL4):
To replace your missing lower left second premolar and first premolar, we suggest placing dental implants. Implants are titanium posts surgically placed into the jawbone to serve as artificial tooth roots. After healing, custom-crafted porcelain crowns will be attached to the implants, providing natural-looking and functional replacement teeth. This will help to restore your bite, prevent shifting of adjacent teeth, and maintain the health of your jawbone.

4. Composite Restoration (36 and 34):
To repair the decayed and damaged lower left first molar and first premolar, we recommend composite restorations. This tooth-colored material will be applied to the affected areas, sculpted to restore the shape and function of your teeth, and then hardened using a special light. Composite restorations are a conservative and affordable way to enhance the appearance and strength of your teeth.

The estimated duration of your entire treatment plan is [estimated time frame]. We will work closely with you to ensure that each step of the process is as comfortable and efficient as possible. Our team is dedicated to providing you with the highest quality of care and support throughout your dental journey.

If you have any questions or concerns about the proposed treatment plan, please do not hesitate to contact our office. We are here to help you achieve the healthy, beautiful smile you deserve.

Dear [Patient's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. It was a pleasure to see you at our practice on [date of appointment]. At [Dental Practice Name], we value you as a patient and believe in keeping you informed about your dental health. Please find below a summary of our findings and the proposed treatment plan based on your recent visit.

[Head shot pictures inserted here]

During our consultation, we discussed your dental concerns, which include:

A narrow upper arch that requires expansion to create more space
Crowded and misaligned teeth that need orthodontic correction
An impacted upper lateral incisor that requires surgical exposure and bonding of a gold chain
[Retracted and smile shot images inserted here]

We also reviewed your dental history and the impact of these issues on your oral health, facial development, and self-confidence.

[Lateral images inserted here]

Upon examination, we noted the following:

A constricted upper arch that can benefit from palatal expansion
Misaligned teeth requiring fixed orthodontic treatment (braces)
An impacted upper lateral incisor that needs surgical exposure and orthodontic traction
[Black contrast images upper and lower]
[Occlusal images]

To address these findings, we have developed a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your unique needs:

Palatal Expander: To create more space in your upper arch and improve your bite, we recommend using a palatal expander. This appliance is custom-made to fit your upper teeth and palate, and it works by gradually widening the upper jaw over time. You will need to activate the expander by turning a small key as instructed by our team. The expansion process typically takes several weeks to a few months, depending on your individual needs. This phase of treatment will help to create the necessary space for your teeth to align properly.
Fixed Braces: Once your upper arch has been expanded, we will proceed with fixed orthodontic treatment (braces) to straighten your teeth and improve your bite. Braces consist of brackets bonded to your teeth and connected by an archwire. The wire is adjusted periodically to apply gentle pressure and guide your teeth into their desired positions. You will need to visit our office regularly for adjustments and progress checks. The duration of your braces treatment will depend on the complexity of your case, but it typically ranges from 12 to 24 months.
Surgical Exposure and Gold Chain Bonding (Impacted Lateral Incisor): To address your impacted upper lateral incisor, we will work with an oral surgeon to perform a surgical exposure. This procedure involves lifting the gum tissue to expose the impacted tooth. A small gold chain will then be bonded to the tooth, allowing us to apply gentle traction and guide the tooth into its proper position in the dental arch. This process may take several months, and we will closely monitor your progress to ensure the best possible outcome.
The estimated duration of your entire treatment plan is [estimated time frame]. We understand that undergoing orthodontic treatment as a teenager can be challenging, but our team is here to support you every step of the way. We will work closely with you to ensure that your treatment is as comfortable and efficient as possible, and we will provide you with the tools and guidance you need to maintain good oral hygiene throughout your journey.

If you have any questions or concerns about the proposed treatment plan, please do not hesitate to contact our office. We are here to help you achieve the healthy, beautiful smile you deserve.

Dear [Patient's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. It was a pleasure to see you at our practice on [date of appointment]. At [Dental Practice Name], we value you as a patient and believe in keeping you informed about your dental health. Please find below a summary of our findings and the proposed treatment plan based on your recent visit.

[Head shot pictures inserted here]

During our consultation, we discussed your dental concerns, which include:
- Missing all upper teeth and the need for a full-arch restoration
- Missing lower left first molar and second premolar (LL6 and LL5)
- Missing lower right first molar and second premolar (LR6 and LR5)
- Desire for a fixed, stable, and functional solution for your missing teeth

[Retracted and smile shot images inserted here]

We also reviewed your dental history and the impact of these issues on your oral health, nutrition, and quality of life.

[Lateral images inserted here]

Upon examination, we noted the following:
- Complete edentulism (missing all teeth) in the upper arch
- Missing LL6, LL5, LR6, and LR5 teeth in the lower arch
- Adequate bone volume and density to support dental implants
- Need for a full-arch restoration in the upper jaw and single-tooth restorations in the lower jaw

[Black contrast images upper and lower]
[Occlusal images]

To address these findings, we have developed a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your unique needs:

1. All-on-4 Implants (Upper Arch):
To replace your missing upper teeth and provide a fixed, stable restoration, we recommend the All-on-4 implant system. This innovative technique involves placing four strategically positioned implants in your upper jaw to support a full-arch prosthesis. The implants are placed at an angle to maximize contact with available bone and to avoid the need for bone grafting. A temporary fixed bridge will be attached to the implants on the same day as the surgery, allowing you to leave our office with a functional and aesthetic smile. After a healing period of several months, a final fixed bridge will be fabricated and attached to the implants, providing a permanent solution for your upper teeth.

2. Implants and Crowns (LL5, LL6, LR5, LR6):
To replace your missing lower left and right molars and premolars, we propose placing two implants in each region (LL5, LL6, LR5, LR6). After a healing period of several months to allow the implants to integrate with your jawbone, we will attach custom-crafted porcelain crowns to the implants. These crowns will be designed to match the color, shape, and size of your natural teeth, providing a seamless and functional result. Implant-supported crowns offer a durable, stable, and long-lasting solution for replacing missing teeth.

The estimated duration of your entire treatment plan is [estimated time frame]. We will work closely with you to ensure that each step of the process is as comfortable and efficient as possible. Our team is dedicated to providing you with the highest quality of care and support throughout your dental journey.

If you have any questions or concerns about the proposed treatment plan, please do not hesitate to contact our office. We are here to help you achieve the healthy, beautiful smile you deserve.

Thank you for referring the above patient to me for the assessment of their UR6. 



I saw them on the 1/8/2024 for their consultation. 



Clinical Examination

At the time of presentation the tooth was symptomatic.The patient reported no previous endodontic treatment had been undertaken.

The tooth was restored with composite and was tender to percussion following testing. The surrounding soft tissue was sensitive upon palpation with swelling associated upon examination. Following a localised periodontal exam there were no issues of concern.



Diagnosis

Following clinical and radiographic assessment the following diagnosis was noted:

Tooth: UR6 
Pulpal: Symptomatic Irreversible Pulpitis
Periapical: Condensing Osteitis
Adjunctive details: Nil 



Prognosis

I have advised the patient the tooth has a good prognosis. 


Following discussion including the risks, benefits and treatment options the patient has opted to proceed with endodontic treatment with myself.


?Treatment Plan

Dear Dr. ______,

I treated a very nice patient of yours today, John Doe.  John is graduating from Gonzaga University in a few weeks in accounting; he has accepted a job in Tacoma.

John reports hitting his teeth while climbing into a hot tub this past weekend; he fractured the incisal edge of #9 into dentin; no pulpal exposure; not symptomatic.  #10 also shows enamel craze lines, but no fractures.

I restored #9 with Herculite shade D-2.  It was a quick emergency fix; I informed him that you may want to fine tune the color with more composite or porcelain.  However, if he is okay with the shading, this could be a long-term restoration.

I informed him of increased risk of pulpal abscess that may require root canal treatment in the future, and reviewed what signs to watch out for.

Thanks for sending John our way!

Sincerely,

Dr. _______

Referral To Periodontist For Comprehensive Evaluation
Dear Dr Perio:

I have referred [patient] to you for comprehensive perio/restorative/implant evaluation.  FMX from 2/9/2010 enclosed; you may keep.

Joe has been a patient since 1994.  He is 52 years old.  He has always been very sporadic with his recalls.  Last scaling/root planing was in 2008.  Last cleaning/exam was 3/2009.

He has always had a high caries rate.  He is a controlled diabetic, but he drinks lots of soda pop.  I have warned him many times in the past that it is destroying his mouth.  His decay always seems to be deeper than expected when we get into it clinically; dentin seems softer than normal.  He quit smoking last month.

Problems identified at 2/9/10 exam:

Caries 2DB, 4D & B, 5B, 7F & L, 9F, 13B, 14L, 15L, 29B.
Periapical radiolucencies on 3 (fractured root?), 9, 22, 30; possibly 5.
Chronic generalized adult periodontitis
Options for upper arch are:

Restoring with all new crowns, bridges, and implants;
Saving some teeth; crown abutments; making removable partial denture;
Full upper denture, possibly with implant retention.
On lower arch, the 21-22 cantilever bridge might be lost after 22 RCT; may need implant.  Otherwise the lower arch is savable with a crown on 29.

Joe was undecided on which course of action to take.  I suggested a consult with you so we could formulate some treatment plan options to present to him.  Let’s get together to discuss this case.

Sincerely,

Dr. ______
Referral To Periodontist For Comprehensive Evaluation
Dear Dr. Perio:

I have referred [patient] to you for comprehensive periodontal treatment.  FMX taken 4/27/2010 enclosed.  Dr. OralSurgeon took a recent panelipse radiograph.

Jane was new to me last month.  She presented with #31 root fracture.  She was referred to Dr. OralSurgeon who extracted the tooth.

Today we did our new patient exam.

Last dental work was about 4 years ago.
She said she has had periodontal surgery many years ago.
Many 5 & 6mm pockets; generalized attachment loss.
#8-x-10 has a temporary bridge made about 5 years ago; recurrent caries; perforated.
She had a nightguard in the past.  Dog chewed it up; she now wears an over-the-counter sports guard.
Very heavy black tobacco stain.
My preliminary restorative treatment plan:

#8-x-10 fixed bridge
#15 crown (has fractured cusp)
nightguard
You might uncover more restorative needs during her initial therapy.

I explained to her that she has very active periodontal disease, and might need aggressive treatment to avoid further tooth loss; importance of 3-month cleanings for the long term; possibility that even with treatment she will still lose some teeth.

Referral to Periodontist For Grafting
Dear Dr. Perio:

I have referred [patient name] to you for grafting evaluation.    I am forwarding duplicate bitewing x-rays (4/18/2008) and panorex (6/16/2008) taken at Dr. Olddentist's office.

Jim came to me as a new patient yesterday for a consultation.  I spent time discussing his recession, and grafting procedures.  Tooth #6 is the only sensitive area, and this is only to touch.

We reviewed a more gentle brushing technique.  I also recommended a Sonicare.

Jim uses chewing tobacco; I discussed the detrimental effects of this to his oral health.  I informed him that you might not do any grafting until he quits the habit.

I have also recommended a nightguard for him, as he has noticed himself clenching and grinding his teeth.

Let me know if I may supply any more information.

Sincerely,

Dr. _____
Referral to Periodontist For crown lenghtening
Dear Dr. Periodontist:

I have referred [patient name] to you for crown lengthening surgery around #19.  I am sending bitewings and a periapical from 8/13/96.

Jane was a new patient to us last week.  She was a previous patient of [Dr. _____].  She has a good dentition; #19 build-up and crown is the only restorative work we have planned.  I did note generalized gingivitis, but the pocket probings were good.

She remembers being advised of having the caries on #19 treated after she had her baby 2 years ago, but she never followed through with treatment.

I have referred her to [Dr. Endo] for endodontic treatment of 19, and will steer her your way after completion of the root canal work.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Sincerely,

Dr. _______
Referral to periodontist for implant conultation
Dear Dr. Perio:

I have referred [patient] to you for #14 implant evaluation.

She came to me for a second opinion regarding #14.  This tooth has had root canal treatment; the restoration (3/4 porcelain crown) has repeatedly come loose.  Her dentist recommended extraction and bridge, but she wasn’t sure about his recommendation.

When I removed the loose crown, the entire build-up was attached;  margins/fractures on M, L, & D were subgingival; only a very thin buccal wall was left supragingivally.

I feel extraction and implant or fixed bridge would be better than crown lengthening and heroically saving what is left.

I have not taken any other x-rays, as I don’t know if she will be changing dentists yet.

Sincerely,

Dr. _____
Referral to periodontist for implant conultation
Dear Dr. Perio:

I have re-referred [patient] to you for implant consultation.  She didn’t follow through with her original Feb 2010 referral.

I saw Jane today with #4-x-6 bridge off.  Most of #4 fractured inside the crown; #6 had ¾-coverage.

I recemented it with Rely-X (a permanent cement); informed her that it is a temporary repair, and will probably not hold long.

Before implant surgery, I could cut the bridge between 5-6, leaving gold on 6.  She says she would be okay without a temporary.

She still doesn’t seem to know whether she wants to do implants only to replace 4 & 5, or if she should replace all possible missing teeth.

Sincerely,

Dr. ______
Referral to endodontist for RCT
Dear Dr. Endodontist:

We have referred [patient name] to you for treatment of #29.

XXXX was a new patient to us this month.  He needs extensive crown work.  The caries on 29 extends far subgingivally.  I have referred him to Dr. Periodontist for crown lengthening surgery, and comprehensive perio evaluation.  I told Dr. Perio that you might prefer to have the crown lengthening done prior to your completion of RCT.

Also, could you evaluate #2?  It has caries that also extends far subgingivally; it has a periapical abscess, and the canals appear quite calcified.  This tooth might be better treated with removal.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Sincerely,

Dr. ______
Referral to endodontist for RCT and internal whitening
Dear Dr. Endo:

I have referred [patient name] to you for evaluation of #9.  She has a current periapical x-ray with her referral slip.

Kathy is a new patient to me; she came in yesterday for a consultation.  Her chief complaint was dark tooth #9.  She was also concerned about linguoverted #10.

The only history of trauma to this area was a bike accident when she was in first grade.  It occasionally has a dull ache.

The tooth is quite opaque when transilluminated.  On the x-ray, the pulp chamber and canal appears much larger than #8.

I discussed porcelain facing; full crown; possible need for RCT depending on pulpal status.

The more I think about it, however, the more I would like to see the darkening treated via endodontics and internal bleaching if possible.  I think this would give more satisfactory esthetic results; it might still need porcelain facing sometime in future however. 

I have recommended orthodontic treatment to correct #10, as there isn’t enough space to simply tip it forward with a retainer.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Sincerely,

Dr. ______
Referral To Endodontist After Accident
Dear Dr. Endo:

I have referred [patient name] to you for evaluation and treatment.  His father has referral and x-rays, and should be calling for appointment.

I saw Joe on 9/13/2010.  He said he was in a go-kart accident on 9/11/2010.  He has lots of scrapes and bruises.  He fractured 6, 7, 8, & 9.  I noted:

6 — facial enamel sheared off.
7 — fractured almost entirely at gumline; a little facial enamel sticking up; pinpoint vital pulpal exposure.
8 — fractured horizontally; about 3mm of enamel left on facial and lingual; dentin was discolored very deep purple, typical of internal hemorrhage; close to pulp, but no exposure noted.
9 — oblique fracture; no indication of pulp proximity.
My initial impressions:

7 will need root canal treatment due to pulpal exposure and for restorative purposes.
8 probably should be treated also for restorative purposes; given the color of the dentin, I wouldn’t bet on long-term pulpal health anyway.
6 & 9 – see how they test.
I took intraoral photos before I restored them; I will send you a copy via email.

I plan to crown 7, 8, & 9 after endodontic treatment; possibly splinting together 7 & 8.

Sincerely,

Dr. _____
Letter to orthodontist for a referral
Dear Dr. Ortho:

You will be seeing our patient, Irida Bike for comprehensive orthodontic evaluation and treatment.

Irida had a motorized scooter accident on September 7, 2011.  She went to Sacred Heart Emergency Room.  The next day she saw Dr. Oral Surgeon.  He repositioned and splinted the injured teeth; splint was removed October 13th.  A copy of his report is enclosed.

Irida then saw Dr. Endodontist for root canal treatment of #8, 9, & 24.

I first saw Irida for evaluation on October 25th.  We built up #24 with a huge composite.  She still needs composites on 7, 8, & 9, but tooth alignment and occlusion would not allow for very good restorations.  I’m sending a copy of photos taken that day.

I am hoping that you will be able to initiate orthodontic treatment, and at least improve anterior alignment so I will be able to place composite restorations.

I need to see Irida one more time to remove the Cavit and seal #8 & 9 RC access holes with composites, preferably before you begin treatment. 

Please call me if you need any further information.

Sincerely,

Referall for extraction of all four wisdom teeth due to sever pericorinitis and balancing extractions
Dear [Oral Surgeon's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to refer my patient, [Patient's Name], to your practice for specialized oral surgery treatment. [Patient's Name], a [age]-year-old [male/female], has been under my care at [Dental Practice Name] since [date]. After a thorough examination and discussion of their dental needs, I believe they would greatly benefit from your expertise in wisdom tooth extraction under general anesthesia.

Medical History:
[Patient's Name] has a history of [relevant medical conditions, if any]. They are currently taking [list of medications] and have no known allergies. Their last physical examination was on [date], and their vital signs were within normal limits. [Patient's Name] has expressed a preference for general anesthesia due to [reasons, such as dental anxiety or complex medical history].

Dental History:
[Patient's Name] has a history of [relevant dental conditions, treatments, or surgeries]. They have been experiencing severe pericoronitis associated with their wisdom teeth since [approximate date or duration]. [Patient's Name] has maintained regular dental check-ups and cleanings every [frequency] months.

Current Dental Condition:
During our most recent examination on [date], we noted the following:
- All four wisdom teeth (teeth #18, #28, #38, and #48) are present and partially erupted
- Radiographic evaluation on [date] revealed [findings, such as impaction, caries, or periodontal disease]
- Severe pericoronitis affecting [specify which wisdom teeth are affected]
- Limited space for proper eruption and hygiene, increasing the risk of future complications

Proposed Treatment Plan:
After careful consideration of [Patient's Name]'s unique needs and the presence of severe pericoronitis, we recommend extraction of all four wisdom teeth under general anesthesia. This approach will ensure patient comfort, safety, and efficient removal of the teeth in a single surgical appointment. Additionally, balancing extractions will be performed to prevent future complications and maintain symmetry in the dental arches.

Given the complexity of this case and the need for specialized surgical skills and anesthesia services, I believe that [Patient's Name] would be best served by your expertise in oral surgery. I am confident that your team will provide the highest quality of care and help [Patient's Name] achieve optimal results.

export const general_notes=[{"text":`The GPT responds in the voice of an experienced academic professor of restorative dentistry at Kings college london who knows they need to be as infromative as possible . the GPTs voice prioritises scholarly articles and scientific research. The GPT always assumes its speaking with a dentist. The GPT always looks at all indexed elements from 1 -140 in Knowledge.json  and indexed elements 1-210 in Dental Questions and Answers.json before  providing a response. It response in the style of a senior professor of restorative dentistry working at kings dental school, London. 

If there are any questions in relation to drugs/ medicines the GPT looks at all indexed elements from 1 -200 in Drugs.json before  providing a response

When answering requests for clinical notes, the GPT writes a completed (not a template) thorough and clinically accurate clinical notes (designed for electronic records) in the voice of a dentolegal defence lawyer who has experience as a dentist but also litigates dentists on missing clinical steps and explaining to patients risks, benefits and immediate effects of a treatment. The dentolegal defence lawyer would create notes which they would use as an example to dentists of  what legally thorough (avoiding consent issues) excellent notes meeting all GDC requirements, dental radiology reporting and clinical guidlines would look like. This dental lawyer voice would never forget a clinical stage and step of treatment no matter how small e.g. etching, bonding, paper points, apex locaters or isolating with a rubber damn (as this is what theyre famous for) and always includes it in the notes.  The notes produced would have been reviewed by his friend, a restorative dentistry professor, who had provided feedback on clinical steps the dental defence lawyer had missed and a General Dental Council Member who had given feedback on educating patients appropriately on risks and benefits and incorporating patient explanations around risks, benefits  and exploring treatment options prior to re-releasing the notes and the the feedback would have been incorporated into the notes. The notes would be a overly detailed textbook clinical example of how to do clinical dentistry including all the steps and details of the steps.  The notes would detail in depth all risks and benefits from the procedure (no matter how small)l if consent is required and in post op instructions.  The intra and extraoral section of the notes would describe the situation in a way that a dentist reading the notes could imagine exactly whats going on. Anytime a radiograph is taken in the notes (e.g. periapical or bitewing)  the dental legal defence lawyer would always includes the type of radiograph, its justification (e.g. periapical taken to assess for periapical pathology or bitewing taken to assess for interproximal caries), radiolucency's, bone levels,  pathology, a grade (1-3 based on quality) and that the radiograph was explained to the patient in the notes. The radiograph is always included in the special test section of the notes. If Local anaesthetic is included, the dental defence lawyer always includes the administration method (e.g. infiltration), the type of local (e.g. articaine 4% with 1:100000 epinephrine) the Batch number and date of expiary. No part of the clinical notes is left blank or includes a "insert x", instead the GPT provide an example of a through and exhaustive response (especially in the presenting complaints, examination, treatment and diagnosis section whereby more details are better) even if its not completely specific to the request. The dental legal defence lawyers voice will have hindsight and know everything that could go wrong with a clinical precedure and with the benefit of hindsight would ensure the notes include a section warn the patient of these issues before undertaking the treatment e.g. if the patient smokes the dentist would warn the patient about the risks of developing oral cancer and provide smoking cessation advice. The notes of the dental defence lawyer is especially  detailed with the presenting complaints and special test section of the notes and especiallly warns of any side effects e.g. pain or sensitivity that may happen after treatment.

If a user asks for a patient letter, letter or email, the GPT  writes a this in a example of excellent, legally safe clinical notes in the style of a experienced dental defence lawyer who was demonstrating what condensed excellence would look like and how to be legally thorough in collaboration with a general dental council member who was helping them meet all GDC and clinical requirements. The response would be an example of "this is what correspondence which meet all guidlines and are impossible to litigate looks like while also maintaining customer centricity". No part of the letter is left blank or includes a "insert here", instead the GPT provide an example of a a through and exhaustive response even if its not completely specific to the request.

When answering questions about treatment options, the GPT always orders the options in terms of least invasive first (e.g. "my patient is concerned about anterior aesthetics associated with MIH, what should I do?" the options whitening, resin infiltration, microabrasion should be said before full coverage crowns or veneers) and never includes implants except in the context whereby extractions are/ could be required or if there is a missing tooth/teeth
